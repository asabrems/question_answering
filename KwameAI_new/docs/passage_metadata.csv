"on 22/5/98 there was a scuffle between the parties at the Fusion Night Club.” Counsel argues that this “scuffle” was amply corroborated by PW1 who was present at the club. His line of argument is that if the trial judge is certain that there was a scuffle between the appellant and the Respondent, then the party who was worse off cannot succeed in an action against the other party simply because he was worse off in the scuffle. His second ground of appeal is that the learned trial judge erred in granting special damages that had not specifically been endorsed on the writ of summons and had not been proved by the Respondent. Counsel’s argument is that in the law of tort, there is a distinction between general and special damages and that one of the distinctions is in the area of pleadings. He supported this submission with the Susque Lava case \[1926\] A.C.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/95/2004', 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ON THE TH DAY OF APRIL  BEFORE', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL SITTING AT ACCRA'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': None, 'year': None, 'month': None, 'day': None}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['NAZIRE ABED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['CHARLES LABA']}, 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Cases from 1993 - 2014\\2000\\COURT OF APPEAL\\NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA', 'short': 'NAZIRE ABED vs CHARLES LABA'}}"
"665 where Lord Dunedin stated at page 661 as follows: “If there be any special damage which is attributable to the wrongful act that special damage must be averred it must be averred that such damage has been suffered but the quantification is a jury question.” Though Counsel argued at length about the award of damages, both general and special, he finally conceded that if the court is inclined to affirm the judgment of the court below and to uphold the damages awarded, the Court must award only nominal damages in the absence of proof of consequential damages suffered by the Respondent. The appellant therefore prays this Court to set aside the award made at the Court below and in its stead make a nominal award in favour of the Respondent. The facts of this case are that on the night of 22nd May 1998 at about 1.00 a.m., the Appellant and the Respondent who were then at the Fusion Night Club, Osu were involved in a scuffle. How did the scuffle start? According to the Respondent, he was seated at a table in the night club with some friends since that date happened to be his 24th birthday and they were celebrating same, when without any provocation from Respondent the Appellant approached their table and asked him to choose a leg to be broken whilst insulting him and his family.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/95/2004', 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ON THE TH DAY OF APRIL  BEFORE', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL SITTING AT ACCRA'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': None, 'year': None, 'month': None, 'day': None}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['NAZIRE ABED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['CHARLES LABA']}, 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Cases from 1993 - 2014\\2000\\COURT OF APPEAL\\NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA', 'short': 'NAZIRE ABED vs CHARLES LABA'}}"
Respondent had then returned from France where he had just had a knee surgery from which he was still recovering and he was therefore using crutches. The Appellant then slapped the Respondent and he was about to “punch” the operated knee when the Respondent held his (Appellant’s) wrist. From the foregoing account which was amply supported by the PW1 (Ali Kwame Maoux) whose evidence-in-chief was to the effect that he saw the Appellant attack the Respondent who was then seated on a bench without any provocation from the latter. This piece of evidence was not discredited under cross-examination nor was any other evidence led through another defence witness to contradict same.

"Thus in the case of Wilson vrs. Pringle \[1986\] 2 AER 440 at page 495 C.A., it was held that “an intention to injure is not essential to an action for trespass to the person which is the offence.” Therefore the culpable touching may take several forms subject to the Rule that the contact must be direct. The principle in awarding damages is to compensate the “Plaintiff” for the losses pecuniary and non-pecuniary which he had sustained as a result of the “Defendant’s” tort – more specifically the assessment process is said to aim at restitutio in integrum. Here we cite the oft-quoted words of Lord Blackburn that “the Court should award that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not suffered the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.” The loss for which the Plaintiff claims compensation must be caused by and must not be too remote a consequence of the defendants tort. Thus in the case before us, the Appellant must reasonably have foreseen that his conduct would aggravate the Respondent’s injury since he knew or should have known that the Respondent was not physically sound considering that he was using crutches.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/95/2004', 'type': None}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ON THE TH DAY OF APRIL  BEFORE', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL SITTING AT ACCRA'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': None, 'year': None, 'month': None, 'day': None}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['NAZIRE ABED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['CHARLES LABA']}, 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Cases from 1993 - 2014\\2000\\COURT OF APPEAL\\NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA', 'short': 'NAZIRE ABED vs CHARLES LABA'}}"

"ATUGUBA, JSC: The sole issue arising in this appeal is who owns the allodial title to Obgojo lands in Accra? Is it the Labadi Stool or the Anahor and Dzirase families of Obgojo village?

Bawuah (1991)2 GLR 20 C.A, as follows: �(2) In this country, land might for generations be in the occupation of persons who were not owners but who might have rights of occupation as licensees or customary tenants or under other conditions known to customary law, the reversion nevertheless being in the owner.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

"And the owners were willing to allow such occupation so long as the occupier did not make any adverse claims to the land. Hence, the mere occupation of land for long periods was not conclusive evidence of ownership; and it was therefore essential that the specific nature and origin of the tenure of occupiers of land should be determined in all cases. In the instant case, the trial judge should consequently have considered the evidence of occupation with caution and should also have made proper findings of fact as to the nature of the plaintiff�s interest in the Asakraka and Ntabaanu portions of the Besease lands, especially in view of the defendant�s claim that the land was given to his ancestors, which claim the plaintiff contested. However, apart from stating that the plaintiff had exercised acts of ownership over the land, the learned trial judge did not make any findings on the nature and origin of the plaintiff�s possession even though he made positive findings of fact, supported by the evidence on record, as to the settlement of the defendant�s family on the land.

One of them is that the first settlers of Obgojo lands are the Anahor and Dzirase families. Accordingly the only question is whether the allodial title was thereby acquired by them. How and in what capacity the land in dispute was acquired is of course a question of fact in the light of the customary law. There is no doubt that one of the ways of establishing an allodial title of a stool is occupation and user of the land in question by its subjects after its acquisition by the stool. However occupation and user of land by stool subjects is not necessarily proof of the stool�s title to the land in question.,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

"With this finding I am in entire agreement, and I may say at once that I concur with all the findings of fact of the Court below upon the point. The most fundamental is the acceptance of the respondent�s story of the acquisition of the lands in question by conquest so that they became Labadi Stool lands. It was clearly proved that Labadi lands extend well beyond Nkwantanang. For instance Frafraha is further north than Nkwantanang, and the first claimant�s own evidence is �Frafraha is a Labadi village ....Nkwantanang is in the middle of all these Labadi villages� The overwhelming weight of evidence supports the finding of the Court below �that at the time that Kotei Amli settled at Nkwantanang the land in the neighbourhood which the claimants described as waste land at that time was the property of the Stool of Labadi.� It seems to me that this finding decides the whole case, it means that from the outset the occupation by Kotei Amli was not adverse to the Labadi Stool and there is nothing to suggest that its nature has changed since.

The peculiar control of the Mimhene over those lands derived historically from the prowess of the people of Mim in abating threats to Ashanti from that area and the role of the Mimhene as a scout at an Ashanti outpost. Consequently, neither the allodial owner, the Akwaboahene, nor the Asantehene could by-pass the Mim stool in the alienation of Mim stool lands. Similarly neither the sub-stools of Ayomso nor Goaso could encroach on neighbouring territory or alienate Mim stool lands.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

A general statement of customary land law is that for a piece of land to belong to a head stool, it must first of all belong to or be attached to a sub-stool or quarter under the head-stool or head-skin. Therefore to say that any land, particularly land in the occupation of members of a quarter or sub-stool, belongs to a head-stool, and in the same breath say that that very land is not attached or does not belong to a sub-stool or quarter is to fall into a grievous error; it is a contradiction in terms.

"In this case, the evidence was that Ogbojo village was founded by Okotse Adjah and Nii Okaifio, who on the evidence hailed from La; their descendants comprised the Anahor Jirase family, the occupants of Ogbojo village.

"DECISION OF TRIAL COURT �As regards the question whether a family can own any of the La rural lands, this is what the Supreme Court has to say per Taylor JSC at page 325 �I am not prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case that La rural lands belong to the La Stool. Both cases however did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own the land.� The implication I gather from this is that irrespective of the decision in the C.B Owusu case, if the Dzrase and Anahor families of Ogbojo are able to prove their ownership of the Ogbojo lands effectively, this court can pronounce them owners of the land. What are the facts the defendant is grounding this claim on as against the claim of the Plaintiff? These facts are as follows: a) their ancestor Okotse Adjah or Torgbortse Adjah found the land through hunting and searching for herbs. b) Nii Okangfio later joined Okotse Adjah and together they established the Ogbojo village, the descendants of these two men have exercised acts of ownership over the Ogbojo lands over the years without any objection from the La Stool.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

Earlier on in her judgment, the trial judge had dismissed the case against the co-defendant as having been unnecessarily joined to the suit. (See page 259-260 of the record) Obviously aggrieved by the decision at the trial, Plaintiff filed an appeal in the court of appeal on the following grounds: GROUNDS OF APPEAL On the 17th of January 2008, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the trial court. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal were of the view that the Supreme Court nearly failed to provide a clear decision in the Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd case already referred to as to lead the lower courts. They therefore made a finding that the Ogbojo lands were La Rural lands belonging to the La Stool and accordingly declared title in the stool.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

"In the unanimous decision of this court in the case of Morkor v Kuma \[1998-99\] SCGLR 620, Sophia Akuffo JSC delivering the lead judgment stated as follows: �Since the Appellant had been jointly sued with the 1st Defendant, a limited liability company, for the only reason that she was the chief executive, main shareholder and a director of the company, she would be a proper party to the suit only if a specific personal liability were established against her�� The fact of joinder in this instant case fits squarely into that of Morkor v Kuma supra and it is manifest that no claim of specific personal liability has been established against the 2nd Co-Defendant. In the interest of justice, the order of their Lordships in the Court of Appeal against the Co-Defendants generally would be reversed and the one made by the trial judge affirmed only to the effect that 2nd Co-Defendant be struck out as a party. This is because; it is only the distinct legal and corporate entities that will be maintained as parties to the suit.

"That was primarily because the trial judge had the advantage of listening to the entire evidence and watching the reactions and demeanour of the parties and their witnesses�� In Re Krobo Stool (No.1); Nyamekye (No.1) v Opoku \[2000\] SCGLR 347 basically re-echoes the point made above. As per Atuguba JSC, � it is a worn-out principle of law that findings of fact made by a trial court are presumed to be right�� Akuffo JSC also made the point that �if the totality of the evidence on record sufficiently supports the conclusion�, it is not our function as an appellate Court to substitute our evaluation of the evidence in place of Nananom merely on the basis that, from our perspective, particular pieces of evidence ought to have been assigned more or less weight�� It was further held by Atuguba and Akuffo JJSC that since the parties had proffered conflicting traditional evidence in support of their respective claims, the law required that recent events supporting the claim of either party should sway the determination of the dispute. Thus the evidence of traditional history tested against recent events, relied upon by both the Kumasi Traditional Council and the National House of Chiefs in preferring the defendant�s version of the founding of the Krobo Stool was amply supported by the totality of the evidence on record� The above dictum admits of no ambiguity in applying it to the present case. The trial judge had laid out the findings of fact as could be gleaned from the record and indeed gave reasons why she preferred the account of the Defendant to the Plaintiff.

"With all due respect to their Lordships in the Court of Appeal, even if they disagreed with her conclusions, they were bound by the decisions supra of the Supreme Court and should have adverted their minds to it before over turning the decision of the learned trial judge, especially on the facts.

J4/7/2009, 3rd February, 2010 CORAM: Date-Bah JSC, Presiding, Adinyira, Owusu, Dotse and Anin-Yeboah JJSC reiterated the same principles of law on findings of fact by a trial court and referred to the following cases as well. In the Assemblies of God v Ransford Obeng case referred to supra, Dotse JSC stated that, unless an appellate Court, such as this Court and the Court of Appeal for that matter, are satisfied that there are strong pieces of evidence on record which are manifestly clear that the findings of fact by the trial court are perverse and therefore unreliable, the appellate Court must be slow in interfering with the said findings of fact.

Further, on the question of law, the issue of estoppel by conduct was raised and resolved by the trial judge, relying on the ratio in Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd supra.

In the circumstances the stool could not now assert any title against an innocent purchaser who had dealt with the Agbawe family following the La stool's inaction and acquiescence. Consequently, as against the appellant, the La stool were estopped by conduct from impugning the appellant's title which had been perfected by registration and his possessory acts.� The facts which informed the above decision in the Nartey case are basically the same in the instant case.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

"There is no evidence on the record that the La stool ever raised any objection to the alienation of the Ogbojo lands or had ever given its consent or made any grants on its own. If indeed it owned the lands, then the trial judge was right in making the finding that it had stood by and allowed the people of Ogbojo to believe that they indeed had absolute ownership of the land. The learned trial judge was therefore right in the observation made that the La Stool was making claims to the land because it had appreciated in value, and this was supported by the record and in holding that they were caught by the equitable doctrine of estoppel by conduct in applying the law to the facts as on the record.

Another compelling and good reason why the position stated by the Court of Appeal cannot be allowed to stand is the opinion stated by Adade JSC, which I agree with in the case of NARTEY V MECHANICAL LLOYD ASSEMBLY PLANT \[1987-88\] 2GLR 314 holding (a) where he stated as follows: �In our customary law the concept of ownership, particularly of land, is not the same as in other jurisdictions. For instance, ownership does not necessarily carry with it the right of exclusive control. And where land belonging to or attaching to a paramount stool is in the care and possession of a sub-stool, control often becomes a shared responsibility between the paramount stool and the sub-stool.� For the above reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeal with respect is flawed and it should not be allowed to stand.

In the first place, the proposition of law is premised upon the fact that the land in dispute belongs to the La Stool or to the Head Stool. However, as in the instant case, where the trial court made definite findings of fact, based upon evidence that had been led before it, that, the Ogbojo Stool, and not the La Stool owned the allodial title, this fact is incontrovertible and is accepted as a correct finding of fact. In the circumstances, the premise upon which the Owusu v Manche of Labadi case had been decided is inapplicable in the instant case and therefore cannot hold.

"So also did the Mantsemei of Adentan, Mpehoasem, etc all without reference to the La Mantse. It would seem to me that on the evidence the La Mantse's claim to own those lands is, to say the least, tenuous, Owusu (supra) notwithstanding.� The death knell of the effect of the decision in Owusu appear to have been loudly sang in the words of Adade JSC which clearly asserted the rights of the sub-stools to make grants of the stool lands. Taylor JSC of blessed memory, on his part went straight to the point and sought to limit the scope of the operation of the principle established by the West African Court of Appeal (WACA) in the Owusu case in 1933. Per Taylor JSC: �One very relevant fact which no doubt influenced and apparently dominated the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in this case, is part of proceedings in a 1932 suit which was tendered in evidence and in which the predecessor in title of the appellant's grantor, one Adjaye Komi, had clearly given evidence that Frafraha lands belonged to the La Stool.

"Manche of Labadi (1933) 1 W.A.C.A. 278� There is no doubt at all that in Owusu v Manche of Labadi (supra) were firm pronouncements made that Frafraha lands are La Stool lands. In Hammond vrs Odoi \[1982-83\] GLR 1215, SC we dealt with approval, quite exhaustively with the holding in the Court of Appeal that Osu rural lands properly belonged to the Osu Stool. La and Osu are contiguous and would seem to have not too divergent customary practices, it is not therefore easy, nor am I prepared to resist the implication in the Owusu case (supra) that La rural lands belong to the La stool. Both cases however, did not hold that it is impossible for a family to acquire ownership of a rural land and until the facts grounding the ownership of a particular family are tested in a judicial forum against the claim of a stool said to own a rural land, I confess quite frankly that I am not prepared, nor am I in a position to make a judicial pronouncement on the matter.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/21/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['NENE AMEGATCHER FOR THE APPELLANT', 'WILLIAM A.

"That problem in my view does not arise in this appeal� In view of the doubts operating on the mind of Taylor JSC in this Owusu case and its general application, Taylor JSC stated quite clearly that, in the interest of justice, and having regard to the Owusu case, and for the purpose of this case, only he was prepared to accept the evidence led by the La Manste that �the Mantsemei of Adentan, Oyarifa and Frafraha holds the lands in their respective villages as caretakers for the La Stool�. With this caveat, and taking the antecedents of the instant case into consideration, is it not clearly established by the evidence led by the Mantse of Ogbojo in respect of the long period of uninterrupted usage, control and alienation of the lands in dispute without any reference to the La Stool had crystallised into rights of ownership which the La Stool can no longer contest and plead the Owusu case as an estoppel per rem judicatam? It would appear therefore that, the Owusu case had been put into a scenario capable of different applications depending upon the circumstances of each case. It was this window of hope and expansion that has been made in the Owusu case over the years that emboldened the learned trial judge not to apply it.

"A. Osae and others case, the Supreme Court identified 1927 as the year in which the Quarter lands were shared among the five Quarters of Teshie. That being the case, it presupposes that, the Otinshie family must have settled and occupied this Otinshie village, long before 1927. Long and uninterrupted possession, occupation, coupled with the incidents of ownership and occupation together with the overt acts of ownership are crucial in any determination between rival claimants of allodial title especially as in the instant case, where one of the claimants is a Head Stool and the other a sub-stool.

"GBADEGBE JSC: In the action out of which this appeal arises, the plaintiff obtained judgment against the defendant for defamation and was awarded damages as well as an order directed at the defendant to publish a retraction of the publication on which the action turned. The defendant claiming to be aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial High Court appealed there from to the Court of Appeal. Pending the determination of the appeal, the defendant applied to the trial Court for an order of stay of execution of the orders of the Court. The application having been refused by the High Court, the defendant filed a repeat application that was authorized under the rules of the Court of Appeal. In its ruling dated 3rd March 2010, the Court of Appeal granted the application for stay of execution of the judgment of the High Court pending the determination of the appeal.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"The instant proceedings arise as a result of the appeal by the plaintiff from the order of stay of execution that was granted by the Court of Appeal. In the notice of appeal on which these proceedings are based, the plaintiff raised several grounds of complaint against the delivery of the Court of Appeal. The delivery herein is sequential to the submission to the court by the parties of their respective statements of case. In considering the appeal herein, we propose to examine the grounds in the order in which they were argued in the plaintiff’s statement of case filed on 7th July 2010. This being the position, we commence with the ground that was formulated as follows: “The court erred in granting an application that was manifestly incompetent.” The above ground, in our opinion is expressed in vague or general terms contrary to the provisions of rule 6.5 of the Supreme Court rules, CI 16 which is in the following words.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"“A ground of appeal which is vague or general in terms or does not disclose a reasonable ground of appeal is not permitted, except the general ground that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence and a ground of appeal or part of it which is not permitted under this rule, may be struck out by the Court on its own motion or on application by the respondent.” This rule permits the court to strike out offending grounds of appeal but since we allowed the parties to address us on the said offending ground and in order not to deny the parties of the benefit of the submissions made there under, we would take it into account in the consideration of the appeal herein. It is hoped, however that this indulgence be not construed as a relaxation of the requirement of the rule on the content of grounds of appeal and that in the future the Court would apply the provisions of the rule strictly in order to achieve the purpose for which they were expressly made namely regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. In our opinion, it is not unreasonable to say that all persons who appear before this Court are of the expectation that the processes and steps that they take in any action or matter before the Court must, to be competent conform to the provisions of the Supreme Court Rules, CI 16.See: DAHABIEH v S A TURQUI \[2001-2002\] SCGLR 498. In his arguments under the first ground, the plaintiff contended that since the application whose refusal is the subject-matter of this appeal was a repeat application under rule 28 0f the Court of Appeal Rules CI 19, the applicant ought to have provided in the affidavit supporting it that a previous application to the trial High Court had been made and refused. The plaintiff cited no authority to support his contention but suffice it to say that even if the said position were correct his conduct in swearing to an affidavit on the merits as well as exhibiting to his affidavit in answer to the application the ruling of the High Court on the application for stay have the effect of waiving what was a mere irregularity.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"Therefore, in our view this ground fails. See: Re MCRAE (1883), 25 Ch.D. 16 We then pass to a consideration of the next ground which was expressed thus: “The Court of Appeal erred in interfering with the exercise of discretion by the trial High Court judge in the absence of any indication that the trial judge’s discretion was not judicially exercised.” In support of this ground several cases were referred to on the principle that where a court below exercises a discretion on a matter before it, an appellate court should not substitute is own discretion for that of the court from which the appeal is mounted. A careful reading of the cases on which great reliance was placed by the plaintiff informs us that none of them deals with a repeat application but were pronouncements made in cases where the appellate courts were exercising the jurisdiction by way of an appeal from the exercise of discretion in a Court below. I think that although the application before the Court of Appeal involved the exercise of a discretion, to constrain the court in such matters to cases in which the jurisdiction to determine a discretionary matter is one primarily for the trial court which may only be reheard following an appeal lodged therefrom is to miss the difference between the two jurisdictions.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"While in one case the jurisdiction is primarily that of the trial court for example in an application for interlocutory injunction made to the trial court in the exercise of its jurisdiction and not consequent upon an appeal; in cases where an appellate Court exercises a repeat jurisdiction following a previous refusal by the trial court as for example in applications for stay of execution pending the determination of an appeal that is specifically provided for by the rules of Court the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the appellate court though is in relation to the same relief is independent and enables the appellate court to determine the matter with a view to doing justice to the parties. We make reference to rule 28 of the Court of Appeal Rules, CI 19 that provides as follows: “ Subject to these Rules and to any other enactment, where under an enactment an application may be made to the Court below or to the Court, it shall be made in the first instance to the Court below, but if the Court below refuses to grant the application, the applicant is entitled to have the application determined by the Court.” See: Twum JSC (as he then was) in the case of Ex-parte Ghana Cable Ltd \[2005-2006\] SCGLR 107 at 109. We think that to reach any other conclusion on the nature of the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Appeal under rule 28 (supra) is to leave parties who lose their cases before trial Courts and whose application for stay of execution have been denied even wrongfully with no other remedy as in most cases such applications find no favor with the Court whose decision is on appeal. This, no doubt would undermine the integrity of the appellate process and render appeals not worth the while. We are of the opinion that no rational judicial system would give effect to the substance of the urgings on us by the plaintiff.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"Accordingly, this ground also fails. This leaves us with the next ground of appeal that was formulated thus: “The ruling was against the weight of the affidavit evidence.” The substance of the arguments submitted under this ground is that a consideration of the rival cases of the parties in terms of the affidavit evidence before the Court of Appeal did not warrant the grant of the application and that the application ought to have been dismissed. We have examined the record of appeal and attended to the very brief submissions made on this point and say without any hesitation that having regard to the orders made by the trial High Court particularly that of a retraction of the publication on which the action was planked, there was the need for the court to judiciously balance the respective rights of the parties in the matter pending the determination of the appeal, and it would have been unreasonable for the plaintiff to publish the retraction only to be adjudged successful on appeal. Then there is also the question of the refund of the judgment debt and costs that were awarded by the trial Court by the plaintiff in the event of the appeal succeeding. We think that the Court of Appeal must have taken these factors into consideration in allowing the application.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"In particular, we think that the learned justices of the Court of Appeal acted rightly in avoiding what might turn out to be an obvious embarrassment if the plaintiff were to publish the retraction ordered under the judgment only to be adjudged victorious on appeal. The effect is that this ground like those preceding it fails. We now turn our attention to the fourth ground. The said ground was expressed as follows: “ The court erred in basing itself on a material not before it and not being part of the evidence led and goading the Defendant\\ Respondent’s counsel on to claim a defence of qualified privilege which was not part of the defendant’s case at all.” The argument on this ground was briefly expressed and it was this. That the defendant did not raise the defence of qualified privilege at the trial but was enabled to have it argued as part of his case at the hearing of the application for stay of execution before the Court of Appeal.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"In our thinking since the said assertion was challenged by the respondent in his statement of case in answer to the plaintiff’s submissions, the obligation was on the plaintiff to demonstrate that his version of the matter was true and in particular making available to the Court the relevant pleadings and the arguments made at the hearing of the application for stay of execution pending the determination of the appeal in the Court of Appeal. Not having sought the inclusion of the relevant documents in the record of appeal at the stage that the record was settled, his version of the record is not borne out by the record of appeal before us and taking into account section 37 of the Evidence Act (NRCD 323) on the presumption of regularity of official acts, this ground fractures and must fail. We now turn to the remaining ground, which is expressed in the following words: “The defendant neither established that the appeal had a reasonable prospect of success nor that irreparable harm will be occasioned by the defendant by a refusal of the application” We observe in regard to this ground that although an application for stay of execution pending appeal may be granted in the discretion of a Court when the judgment on which based is shown by the applicant at the hearing to suffer from an erroneous statement of law or that a refusal would occasion irreparable harm or inconvenience to the applicant these are not the only reasons for which a court may make a grant. The Court in granting or refusing an application for stay of execution pending the determination of an appeal acts according to well settled principles that enables it to bridge the gap in the intervening period between the delivery of the judgment in the court below and the time that the appeal is finally determined in order to deal with the rights of the parties in the pending appeal by the grant of interim or provisional remedies, which among others ensure that a successful appeal is not rendered nugatory by the making of orders such as that in respect of which the instant proceedings was launched by the plaintiff. We do not think that it is necessary for our decision in this application to embark upon the discussion of the reasons for which a Court may accede to an application for stay of execution.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/45/2010', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['KWASI AFRIFA FOR THE PLAINTIFF/RESPONDENT/APPELLANT', None], 'combinedParties': ['SGT.

"It is sufficient for the purpose of this decision to say that an examination of the ruling the subject-matter of these proceedings reveals that it was delivered taking into account settled principles in such cases and appears to us taking into account the processes on which the application was based that there were sufficient materials before them that justified their conclusion.

"The remaining five remained in the bank’s custody until they were ultimately sold by the bank. The bank claimed to be exercising rights under the original loan agreement that it had concluded with the farming company. But this agreement was never put in evidence at the trial. Eventually, the five tractors released to the company were also seized by the bank and sold. The farming company brought this action in 1993, claiming: a)“that an account be taken of the proceeds obtained by the Defendants from the operation of 5 (five) Renault agricultural tractors belonging to the Plaintiffs from 1988 to date of disposal plus interest on such proceeds at the rate of 26% or the prevailing bank rate whichever is higher; b)that an account be taken of the proceeds obtained from the sale of 10 (ten) Renault tractors belonging to Plaintiffs by defendants plus interest thereon at 26% or the prevailing bank rate whichever is higher; c)General damages for wrongful detention and disposal of 20 (sic) (ten) Renault tractors the property of the plaintiffs by the defendants or Alternatively an order for the replacement by the Defendants of the 10 Renault tractors plus damages for their wrongful detention and or wrongful disposal.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

The claim and counterclaim of the company and the bank respectively came before Aryeetey JA, as he then was, for trial at the High Court and he delivered judgment on 30th July 2007 in favour of the company on its claim and dismissed the bank’s counterclaim, after a full trial. The learned trial judge found that the bank, without reference to the farming company, had caused to be sold both the 5 tractors that they had permitted the company to put in use and the 5 brand new and unused tractors which they had refused to release to the plaintiffs. He also found that there was no justification for the bank’s detention of the company’s chattels.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"He found that the relationship between the bank and the company was that of banker and customer and nothing more.

In his own words (at pp. 271-2 of the Record): “However, what is missing from various documents tendered in evidence is what should have been the original loan agreement between the plaintiff company and defendant bank which in the first place facilitated the importation of the ten Renault tractors from France into the country.

"As it turned out by its conduct the defendant bank assumed the role of owners of all the ten tractors that were ordered at the instance of the plaintiff company and in fact were all consigned to the plaintiff company. I do not think that under the missing agreement document the defendant bank had power to seize the tractors on their arrival and assume the right as owners to compel the plaintiffs to agree to completely new terms under new agreements. If that had been the case the defendant bank would have been quick to tender that document in evidence in support of its despicable conduct in seizing the tractors from the plaintiffs.” Although, as noted above, the company sued in tort, the learned trial judge purported to resolve aspects of the case on the basis of a contractual analysis. He was correct in this regard since the bank, having counterclaimed on its contract of loan for the farming company’s outstanding indebtedness to be enforced, put a contractual dimension of the case into play. Aryeetey JA argued that since the bank was in fundamental breach of the contract of loan with the company by unlawfully seizing the tractors belonging to the company, this breach discharged the company from any further obligations under the contract of loan.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"Accordingly, the company was no longer under any obligation to repay the loan that it had received.

"279-80 of the Record): “I am of the view that the breach in respect of the five tractors which the defendant bank kept and were not put to any use until they were sold at its instance together with the five other tractors which it had earlier released for use by the plaintiff company, without any reference to the plaintiff company, was fundamental in that the plaintiff company’s ownership of the tractors and its half measure means of repaying the loan were taken away. It also means that the conversion committed by the defendant bank in both instances which amounted to repudiation of its rights under the contract brought everything to an end and in fact by its conduct the defendant bank forfeited its rights to any further claims under the contract. It would not therefore be expected that the plaintiffs would be required to honour their debt obligation in respect of the ten tractors. On the other hand the plaintiff company would be entitled to pursue a claim for wrongful seizure and detention of their tractors. Indeed the plaintiffs claim for general damages for wrongful detention and disposal of all their ten Renault tractors by the defendants or alternatively an order for the replacement by the defendants of the ten Renault tractors plus damages for their wrongful detention and or wrongful disposal.” This position of the learned trial judge would appear, on close analysis, to be awarding, in effect, double compensation in respect of the same injury arising from the same set of triggering facts.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"As my noble and learned friend Lord Mustill and I have good reason to know (see J Bracconot et Cie v Cie des Messageries Maritimes (The Sindh) \[1975\] 1 Lloyd's Rep 372), France has adopted the former solution in its doctrine of non cumul, under which the concurrence of claims in contract and tort is outlawed (see Weir in XI Int Enc Comp Law, ch 12, paras 47-72, at para 52). The reasons given for this conclusion are (1) respect for the will of the legislator, and (2) respect for the will of the parties to the contract (see para 53). The former does not concern us; but the latter is of vital importance. It is however open to various interpretations. For such a policy does not necessarily require the total rejection of concurrence, but only so far as a concurrent remedy in tort is inconsistent with the terms of the contract.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"It comes therefore as no surprise to learn that the French doctrine is not followed in all civil law jurisdictions, and that concurrent remedies in tort and contract are permitted in other civil law countries, notably Germany (see para 58). I only pause to observe that it appears to be accepted that no perceptible harm has come to the German system from admitting concurrent claims. The situation in common law countries, including of course England, is exceptional, in that the common law grew up within a procedural framework uninfluenced by Roman law. The law was categorised by reference to the forms of action, and it was not until the abolition of the forms of action by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 that it became necessary to reclassify the law in substantive terms. The result was that common lawyers did at last segregate our law of obligations into contract and tort, though in so doing they relegated quasi-contractual claims to the status of an appendix to the law of contract, thereby postponing by a century or so the development of a law of restitution.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"Even then, there was no systematic reconsideration of the problem of concurrent claims in contract and tort. We can see the courts rather grappling with unpromising material drawn from the old cases in which liability in negligence derived largely from categories based upon the status of the defendant. In a sense, we must not be surprised; for no significant law faculties were established at our universities until the late nineteenth century, and so until then there was no academic opinion available to guide or stimulate the judges. Even so, it is a remarkable fact that there was little consideration of the problem of concurrent remedies in our academic literature until the second half of the twentieth century, though in recent years the subject has attracted considerable attention.

"At first, as is shown in particular by cases concerned with liability for solicitors' negligence, the courts adopted something very like the French solution, holding that a claim against a solicitor for negligence must be pursued in contract, and not in tort (see eg, Bean v Wade (1885) 2 TLR 157); and in Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194 this approach was firmly adopted. It has to be said, however, that decisions such as these, though based on prior authority, were supported by only a slender citation of cases, none of great weight; and the jurisprudential basis of the doctrine so adopted cannot be said to have been explored in any depth. Furthermore, when in Bagot v Stevens Scanlan & Co Ltd\[1964\] 3 All ER 577 at 580, \[1966\] 1 QB 197 at 204-205 Diplock LJ adopted a similar approach in the case of a claim against a firm of architects, he felt524compelled to recognise that a different conclusion might be reached in cases 'where the law in the old days recognised either something in the nature of a status like a public calling (such as common carrier, common innkeeper, or a bailor and bailee) or the status of master and servant'.

If concurrent liability in tort is not recognised, a claimant may find his claim barred at a time when he is unaware of its existence. … It can of course be argued that the principle established in respect of concurrent liability in contract and tort should not be tailored to mitigate the adventitious effects of rules of law such as these, and that one way of solving such problems would no doubt be 'to rephrase such incidental rules as have to remain in terms of the nature of the harm suffered rather than the nature of the liability asserted' (see Weir, XI Int Enc Comp Law ch 12, para 72).","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"But this is perhaps crying for the moon; and with the law in its present form, practical considerations of this kind cannot sensibly be ignored. Moreover I myself perceive at work in these decisions not only the influence of the dead hand of history, but also what I have elsewhere called the temptation of elegance. Mr Weir (XI Int Enc Comp Law ch 12, para 55) has extolled the French solution for its elegance; and we can discern the same impulse behind the much-quoted observation of Lord Scarman when delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd \[1985\] 2 All ER 947 at 957, \[1986\] AC 80 at 107: 'Their Lordships do not believe that there is anything to the advantage of the law's development in searching for a liability in tort where the parties are in a contractual relationship. This is particularly so in a commercial relationship. Though it is possible as a matter of legal semantics to conduct an analysis of the rights and duties inherent in some contractual relationships including that of banker and customer either as a matter of contract law when the question will be what, if any, terms are to be implied or as a matter of tort law when the task will be to identify a duty arising from the proximity and character of the relationship between the parties, 525their Lordships believe it to be correct in principle and necessary for the avoidance of confusion in the law to adhere to the contractual analysis: on principle because it is a relationship in which the parties have, subject to a few exceptions, the right to determine their obligations to each other, and for the avoidance of confusion because different consequences do follow according to whether liability arises from contract or tort, eg in the limitation of action.' It is however right to stress, as did Sir Thomas Bingham MR in the present case, that the issue in Tai Hing was whether a tortious duty of care could be established which was more extensive than that which was provided for under the relevant contract.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"At all events, even before Tai Hing we can see the beginning of the redirection of the common law away from the contractual solution adopted in Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194, towards the recognition of concurrent remedies in contract and tort. First, and most important, in 1963 came the decision of your Lordships' House in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd \[1963\] 2 All ER 575, \[1964\] AC 465. I have already expressed the opinion that the fundamental importance of this case rests in the establishment of the principle upon which liability may arise in tortious negligence in respect of services (including advice) which are rendered for another, gratuitously or otherwise, but are negligently performed-viz, an assumption of responsibility coupled with reliance by the plaintiff which, in all the circumstances, makes it appropriate that a remedy in law should be available for such negligence. For immediate purposes, the relevance of the principle lies in the fact that, as a matter of logic, it is capable of application not only where the services are rendered gratuitously, but also where they are rendered under a contract. Furthermore we can see in the principle an acceptable basis for liability in negligence in cases which in the past have been seen to rest upon the now outmoded concept of status.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"In this context, it is of particular relevance to refer to the opinion expressed both implicitly by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest (with whom Lord Hodson agreed) and expressly by Lord Devlin that the principle applies to the relationship of solicitor and client, which is nearly always contractual (see \[1963\] 2 All ER 575 at 590-591, \[1964\] AC 465 at 497-499 where Lord Morris approved the reasoning of Chitty J in Cann v Willson (1888) 39 Ch D 39, and \[1963\] 2 All ER 575 at 610-611, \[1964\] AC 465 at 529 per Lord Devlin). The decision in Hedley Byrne, and the statement of general principle in that case, provided the opportunity to reconsider the question of concurrent liability in contract and tort afresh, untrammelled by the ancient learning based upon a classification of defendants in terms of status which drew distinctions difficult to accept in modern conditions. At first that opportunity was not taken.Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194 was followed by the Court of Appeal in Cook v S \[1967\] 1 All ER 299, \[1967\] 1 WLR 457, and again in Heywood v Wellers(a firm) \[1976\] 1 All ER 300, \[1976\] QB 446; though in the latter case (see \[1976\] 1 All ER 300 at 306, \[1976\] QB 446 at 459) Lord Denning MR was beginning to show signs of dissatisfaction with the contractual test accepted in Groom v Crocker-a dissatisfaction which crystallised into a change of heart in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon \[1976\] 2 All ER 5, \[1976\] QB 801. That case was concerned with statements made by employees of Esso in the course of pre-contractual negotiations with Mr Mardon, the prospective tenant of a petrol station.

"Mr526Mardon was persuaded by the statements to enter into the tenancy; but he suffered serious loss when the actual throughput proved to be much lower than had been predicted. The Court of Appeal held that Mr Mardon was entitled to recover damages from Esso, on the basis of either breach of warranty or (on this point affirming the decision of the judge below) negligent misrepresentation. In rejecting an argument that Esso's liability could only be contractual, Lord Denning MR dismissed Groom v Crocker as inconsistent with other decisions of high authority, viz Boorman v Brown (1842) 3 QB 511 at 525-526, 114 ER 603 at 608 per Tindal CJ; (1844) 11 Cl & Fin 1 at 44, 8 ER 1003 at 1018-1019 per Lord Campbell; Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd \[1957\] 1 All ER 125 at 139, \[1957\] AC 555 at 587 per Lord Radcliffe; Matthews v Kuwait Bechtel Corp \[1959\] 2 All ER 345, \[1959\] 2 QB 57 and Nocton v Lord Ashburton \[1914\] AC 932 at 956, \[1914-15\] All ER Rep 45 at 54 per Viscount Haldane LC. He then held that, in addition to its liability in contract, Esso was also liable in negligence. The other members of the Court of Appeal, Ormrod and Shaw LJJ, agreed that Mr Mardon was entitled to recover damages either for breach of warranty or for negligent misrepresentation, though neither expressed any view about the status of Groom v Crocker.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"It was however implicit in their decision that, as Lord Denning held, concurrent remedies were available to Mr Mardon in contract and tort. For present purposes, I do not find it necessary to comment on the authorities relied upon by Lord Denning as relieving him from the obligation to follow Groom v Crocker; though I feel driven to comment that the judgments in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon reveal no analysis in depth of the basis upon which concurrent liability rests. That case was, however, followed by the Court of Appeal in Batty v Metropolitan Property Realizations Ltd \[1978\] 2 All ER 445, \[1978\] QB 554, in which concurrent remedies in contract and tort were again allowed. The requisite analysis is, however, to be found in the judgment of Oliver J in Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett Stubbs & Kemp (a firm) \[1978\] 3 All ER 571, \[1979\] Ch 384, in which he held that a solicitor could be liable to his client for negligence either in contract or in tort, with the effect that in the case before him it was open to the client to take advantage of the more favourable date of accrual of the cause of action for the purposes of limitation. In that case Oliver J was much concerned with the question whether it was open to him, as a judge of first instance, to depart from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Groom v Crocker.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"For that purpose, he carried out a most careful examination of the relevant authorities, both before and after Groom v Crocker, and concluded that he was free to depart from the decision in that case, which he elected to do. It is impossible for me to do justice to the reasoning of Oliver J, for which I wish to express my respectful admiration, without unduly prolonging what is inevitably a very long opinion. I shall therefore confine myself to extracting certain salient features. First, from his study of the cases before Groom v Crocker, he found no unanimity of view that the solicitor's liability was regarded as exclusively contractual. … He expressed his conclusion concerning the impact of Hedley Byrne on the case before him in the following words (\[1978\] 3 All ER 571 at 595-596, \[1979\] Ch 384 at 417): 'The case of a layman consulting a solicitor for advice seems to me to be as typical a case as one could find of the sort of relationship in which the duty of care described in the Hedley Byrne case \[1963\] 2 All ER 575, \[1964\] AC 465 exists; and if I am free to do so in the instant case, I would, therefore, hold that the relationship of solicitor and client gave rise to a duty on the defendants under the general law to exercise that care and skill upon which they must have known perfectly well that their client relied.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"To put it another way, their common law duty was not to injure their client by failing to do that which they had undertaken to do and which, at their invitation, he relied on them to do. That duty was broken, but no cause of action in tort arose until the damage occurred; and none did until 17th August 1967. I would regard it as wholly immaterial that their duty arose because they accepted a retainer which entitled them, if they chose to do so, to send a bill to their client.' I wish to express my respectful agreement with these passages in Oliver J's judgment. Thereafter, Oliver J proceeded to consider the authorities since Hedley Byrne, in which he found, notably in statements of the law by members of the Appellate Committee in Arenson v Arenson \[1975\] 3 All ER 901, \[1977\] AC 405 and in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon \[1976\] 2 All ER 5, \[1976\] QB 801, the authority which relieved him of his duty to follow Groom v Crocker \[1938\] 2 All ER 394, \[1939\] 1 KB 194. But I wish to add that, in the course of considering the later authorities, he rejected the idea that there is some general principle of law that a plaintiff who has claims against a defendant for breach of duty both in contract and in tort is bound to rely upon his contractual rights alone.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"He said (\[1978\] 3 All ER 571 at 598, \[1979\] Ch 384 at 420): 'There is not and never has been any rule of law that a person having alternative claims must frame his action in one or the other. If I have a contract with my dentist to extract a tooth, I am not thereby precluded from suing him in tort if he negligently shatters my jaw (Edwards v Mallan \[1908\] 1 KB 1002).' The origin of concurrent remedies in this type of case may lie in history; but in a modern context the point is a telling one. Indeed it is consistent with the decision in Donoghue v Stevenson itself, and the rejection in that case of the view, powerfully expressed in the speech of Lord Buckmaster (see \[1932\] AC 562 esp at 577-578, \[1932\] All ER Rep 1 esp at 10), that the manufacturer or repairer of an article owes no duty of care apart from that implied from contract or imposed by statute.

Attempts have been made to explain how doctors and dentists may be concurrently liable in tort while other professional men may not be so liable, on529the basis that the former cause physical damage whereas the latter cause pure economic loss (see the discussion by Christine French 'The Contract/Tort Dilemma' (1981-84) 5 Otago LR 236 at 280-281).","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"But this explanation is not acceptable, if only because some professional men, such as architects, may also be responsible for physical damage. As a matter of principle, it is difficult to see why concurrent remedies in tort and contract, if available against the medical profession, should not also be available against members of other professions, whatever form the relevant damage may take.The judgment of Oliver J in Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett Stubbs & Kemp (a firm) \[1978\] 3 All ER 571, \[1979\] Ch 384 provided the first analysis in depth of the question of concurrent liability in tort and contract. Following upon Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon \[1976\] 2 All ER 5, \[1976\] QB 801, it also broke the mould, in the sense that it undermined the view which was becoming settled that, where there is an alternative liability in tort, the claimant must pursue his remedy in contract alone. The development of the case law in other common law countries is very striking.

"Next, in Central Trust Co v Rafuse (1986) 31 DLR (4th) 481 Le Dain J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, conducted a comprehensive and most impressive survey of the relevant English and Canadian authorities on the liability of solicitors to their clients for negligence, in contract and in tort, in the course of which he paid a generous tribute to the analysis of Oliver J in the Midland Bank Trust case. His conclusions are set out in a series of propositions (at 521-522); but his general conclusion was to the same effect as that reached by Oliver J. He said (at 522): 'A concurrent or alternative liability in tort will not be admitted if its effect would be to permit the plaintiff to circumvent or escape a contractual exclusion or limitation of liability for the act or omission that would constitute the tort. Subject to this qualification, where concurrent liability in tort and contract exists the plaintiff has the right to assert the cause of action that appears to be the most advantageous to him in respect of any particular legal consequence.' I respectfully agree. Meanwhile in New Zealand the Court of Appeal had appeared at first, in McLaren Maycroft & Co v Fletcher Development Co Ltd\[1973\] 2 NZLR 100, to require that, in cases where there are concurrent duties in contract and tort, the claimant must pursue his remedy in contract alone.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"There followed a period of some uncertainty, in which differing approaches were adopted by courts of first instance. In 1983 Miss Christine French published her article on the contract/tort dilemma in (1981-84) 5 Otago LR 236, in which she examined the whole problem in great depth, with special reference to the situation in New Zealand, having regard to the 'rule' in McLaren Maycroft. Her article, to which I wish to pay tribute, was of course published before the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Central Trust case. Even so, she reached a conclusion which, on balance, favoured a freedom for the claimant to choose between concurrent remedies in contract and tort. Thereafter in Rowlands v Collow \[1992\] 1 NZLR 178 Thomas J, founding himself principally on the Central Trust case and on Miss French's article, concluded that he was free to depart from the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in McLaren Maycroft and to hold that a person530performing professional services (in the case before him an engineer) may be sued for negligence by his client either in contract or in tort.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"He said (190): 'The issue is now virtually incontestable; a person who has performed professional services may be held liable concurrently in contract and in negligence, unless the terms of the contract preclude the tortious liability.' In Australia, too, judicial opinion appears to be moving in the same direction, though not without dissent: see, in particular, Aluminum Products(Qld) Pty Ltd v Hill \[1981\] Qd R 33 (a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland) and Macpherson & Kelley v Kevin J Prunty & Associates \[1983\] 1 VR 573 (a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria). A different view has however been expressed by Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 585, to which I will return later. In principle, concurrent remedies appear to have been accepted for some time in the United States (see Prosser Handbook on the Law of Torts (7th edn, 1984) p 444), though with some variation as to the application of the principle in particular cases. In these circumstances it comes as no surprise that Professor Fleming, writing in 1992, should state that 'the last ten years have seen a decisive return to the ""concurrent"" approach' (see Fleming Law of Torts (8th edn, 1992) p 187). I have dealt with the matter at some length because, before your Lordships, Mr Temple QC for the managing agents boldly challenged the decision of Oliver J in the Midland Bank Trust case \[1978\] 3 All ER 571, \[1979\] Ch 384, seeking to persuade your Lordships that this House should now hold that case to have been wrongly decided.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"This argument was apparently not advanced below, presumably because Oliver J's analysis had received a measure of approval in the Court of Appeal: see eg Forster v Outred & Co (a firm) \[1982\] 2 All ER 753 at 764, \[1982\] 1 WLR 86 at 99 per Dunn LJ. Certainly there has been no sign of disapproval, even where the Midland Bank Trust case has been distinguished: see Bell v Peter Browne & Co (a firm) \[1990\] 3 All ER 124, \[1990\] 2 QB 495. Mr Temple adopted as part of his argument the reasoning of Mr J M Kaye in an article The Liability of Solicitors in Tort (1984) 100 LQR 680. In his article Mr Kaye strongly criticised the reasoning of Oliver J both on historical grounds and with regard to his interpretation of the speeches in Hedley Byrne. However, powerful though Mr Kaye's article is, I am not persuaded by it to treat the Midland Bank Trust case as wrongly decided.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"First, so far as the historical approach is concerned, this is no longer of direct relevance in a case such as the present, having regard to the development of the general principle in Hedley Byrne. No doubt it is correct that, in the nineteenth century, liability in tort depended upon the category of persons into which the defendant fell, with the result that in those days it did not necessarily follow that, because (for example) a surgeon owed an independent duty of care to his patient in tort irrespective of contract, other professional men were under a similar duty. Even so, as Mr Boswood QC for the names stressed, if the existence of a contract between a surgeon and his patient did not preclude the existence of a tortious duty to the patient in negligence, there is no reason in principle why a tortious duty should not co-exist with a contractual duty in the case of the broad duty of care now recognised following the generalisation of the tort of negligence in the twentieth century. So far as Hedley Byrne itself is concerned, Mr Kaye reads the speeches as restricting the principle of assumption of responsibility there established to cases where there is no contract; indeed, on this he tolerates no dissent, stating (p 706) 531that 'unless one reads \[Hedley Byrne\] with deliberate intent to find obscure or ambiguous passages' it will not bear the interpretation favoured by Oliver J. I must confess however that, having studied yet again the speeches in Hedley Byrne in the light of Mr Kaye's critique, I remain of the opinion that Oliver J's reading of them is justified.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"It is, I suspect, a matter of the angle of vision with which they are read. For here, I consider, Oliver J was influenced not only by what he read in the speeches themselves, notably the passage from Lord Devlin's speech quoted above (see \[1963\] 2 All ER 575 at 610-611, \[1964\] AC 465 at 528-529), but also by the internal logic reflected in that passage, which led inexorably to the conclusion which he drew. Mr Kaye's approach involves regarding the law of tort as supplementary to the law of contract, ie as providing for a tortious liability in cases where there is no contract. Yet the law of tort is the general law, out of which the parties can, if they wish, contract; and, as Oliver J demonstrated, the same assumption of responsibility may, and frequently does, occur in a contractual context. Approached as a matter of principle, therefore, it is right to attribute to that assumption of responsibility, together with its concomitant reliance, a tortious liability, and then to inquire whether or not that liability is excluded by the contract because the latter is inconsistent with it.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"This is the reasoning which Oliver J, as I understand it, found implicit, where not explicit, in the speeches in Hedley Byrne. With his conclusion I respectfully agree. But even if I am wrong in this, I am of the opinion that this House should now, if necessary, develop the principle of assumption of responsibility as stated in Hedley Byrne to its logical conclusion so as to make it clear that a tortious duty of care may arise not only in cases where the relevant services are rendered gratuitously, but also where they are rendered under a contract. This indeed is the view expressed by Lord Keith of Kinkel in Murphy v Brentwood DC \[1990\] 2 All ER 908 at 919, \[1991\] 1 AC 398 at 466, in a speech with which all the other members of the Appellate Committee agreed.” Even though this extended passage from Lord Goff’s speech shows that there can be concurrent liability in contract and tort, the facts of each case will determine whether the extent of any concurrent imposition of a liability in contract and tort is justifiable.

"The learned trial judge relied on the proposition of law enunciated by the Court of Appeal in In re Timber and Transport Kumasi – Krusevac Co. Ltd, Sativa v Bonsu \[1981\] GLR 256 that where a contract party manifests a clear intention to be no longer bound by the terms of the contract or where he openly repudiates it, the innocent party might treat it as at an end and seek such remedies as are open to him or her. In that case, the Court of Appeal said: “The crucial issue which in our view was avoided by the High Court is whether the agreement was still binding on the parties. On this issue, we are thrown back on first principles and particularly on the effect of breaches of an agreement by one or other of the parties.

"402, C.A.” Whilst this statement of the law is largely correct, it needs further clarification in the context of the facts of this case. In this connection, I would like to refer to the analysis of Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law of Contract (15th Ed, 2007) on the effect of discharge by breach, at p. 691: “A party who treats a contract as discharged is often said torescind the contract. To describe the legal position in such a manner, however, must inevitably mislead and confuse the unwary. In its primary and more correct sense, as we have already seen, rescission means the retrospective cancellation of a contract ab initio, as for instance where one of the parties has been guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"In such a case the contract is destroyed as if it had never existed, but its discharge by breach never impinges upon rights and obligations that have already matured. It would be better therefore in this context to talk of termination ordischarge rather than ofrescission.” This analysis is illuminating and I accept it. It is supported by the House of Lords decision in Johnson v Agnew \[1980\] AC 367, where Lord Wilberforce said (at pp. 392-3): “it is important to dissipate a fertile source of confusion and to make clear that although sometimes the vendor is referred to …as ‘rescinding’ the contract, this so-called ‘rescission’ is quite different from rescission ab initio, such as may arise for example, in cases of mistake, fraud or lack of consent. In those cases the contract is treated in law as never having come into existence… In the case of an accepted repudiatory breach the contract has come into existence but has been put an end to, or discharged.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"Whatever contrary indications may be disinterred from old authorities, it is now quite clear, under the general law of contract, that acceptance of a repudiatory breach does not bring about ‘rescission ab initio’."" The implication of this analysis for this case is that the obligations of the company that arose before the date of the conduct by the bank held by the learned trial judge to be in breach of contract are not wiped out but remain binding. The company is released from any further performance of the discharged contract, from the date of discharge, but its accrued obligations remain binding. It cannot therefore be correct to hold that it is relieved from the obligation to repay the loan it contracted and which it had received in full. As at the date of discharge of its contract of loan, the company’s debt obligation (that is, the obligation to repay the loan) had already accrued.

"This is where the concurrent recovery of damages in tort for the same conduct characterized as breach of contract becomes relevant. If the recovery of damages in tort has already secured for the company a restitutio in integrum, it follows that only nominal damages can be awarded it for the breach identified by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge’s error in holding that the company was absolved from any obligation under the contract of loan is perpetuated in a different guise by the Court of Appeal and is thus the subject of grounds of appeal before this Court. Grounds (ii) and (iii), which were argued together, are as follows: ii.“The learned Justices of Appeal erred in law when they held that after the consolidation of the debt the Plaintiff/Respondent ceased to be liable for the payment of the debt. iii.The learned Justices misdirected themselves in law on the nature and effect of consolidation of debts which misdirection led them to hold that after consolidation the debt ceased to be payable.” Quaye JA, in delivering the Court of Appeal’s judgment, had said, in relation to the bank’s counterclaim for the payment of the company’s outstanding indebtedness to it, (at p.426 of the Record) that: “The second segment of the counterclaim was in respect of respondent’s outstanding debt.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"Learned Counsel shot himself in the foot when he contended that the various loans that the respondents contracted with the appellants were consolidated at a point in time. This is a correct statement upon the facts and evidence before us. The loans which were consolidated upon the suggestion, advise (sic) or prompting of the appellants were FF 1.958.180.00 for the ten tractors and c707.500.00 other loan. In order to resolve whether the appellants were entitled to the Court’s decision on this segment of the counterclaim to warrant the setting aside of the finding by the trial Court, it is my candid view that we determine the legal meaning and effect of consolidation….” The learned judge then proceeds to define consolidation and then continues: “The point which I want to bring home is that merging, or fusion or consolidation of two loan accounts had the effect of each of them losing its previous separate identity and from the time of consolidation, they become one.

"After that, you cannot identify which was previously contained in one or other of the two containers…. The total effect therefore is that only one loan account stood in the records of the appellants for the obligation of the respondents after the accounts had been consolidated. In Law, it is not available for the appellants to turn round after the merger at their own prompting, to want to see two separate loan accounts. The law would neither allow a party to take advantage of his own wrong nor to approbate and reprobate at the same time….It is therefore clear that, as at the time this action was commenced, and more specifically, at the time the counterclaim was made, there was only one loan account between the appellants and the respondents, irrespective of how the loan was contracted, the purpose(s) for which segments thereof were given and taken or the time it was done.

"If there was, then the appellants failed to lead evidence to establish that fact. I can identify no error in the refusal by the learned trial judge to grant the counterclaim and the reasons supporting his refusal. This ground of appeal fails and it is dismissed.” With respect, the learned Justice of Appeal is in error in his view that the company had no debt liability at the time the counterclaim was filed. Apart from the bank’s objection to the issue of consolidation being a ground of decision when it had not been argued in the appeal, on which I will give my view later in this judgment, the learned Justice seems to make the assumption that the only debt in respect of which there could be liability was the “other loan” of c707,500. That seems to be the explanation for the great lengths to which he went to establish the consolidation of the two loans.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"He seemingly fails to appreciate that the receipt of FF 1.958.180.00 to finance the importation of the ten tractors also resulted in a debt. The counterclaim was thus with reference to both amounts. There is undisputed evidence on record that the bank supplied the funds for purchase of the tractors.

"The arguments rehearsed above apply, mutatis mutandis, to grounds (iv) and (v) of the Appellant before this court, which it argued together. These are: iv.“The learned Justices of Appeal erred in law when they failed to distinguish between the loan contract and the tort of detinue and conversion which failure led to the erroneous decision that the loan (admitted by the Plaintiff/Respondent) ceased to be payable. v.The learned Justices of Appeal erred in law by avoiding the issue of whether or not the tort of detinue and conversion allegedly committed by the Defendant/Appellant amounted to a repudiation of the loan contract which issue was the main basis upon which the trial court rejected Defendant/Appellant’s Counterclaim for the payment of the debt.” In support of these grounds, the bank argued as follows in its Statement of Case (Para. 20): “One of the grounds on which the High Court dismissed the Appellant’s counterclaim for the outstanding debt (see pages 279 – 280 of the Record quoted above) was that by “seizing” the tractors, the Appellant repudiated the loan agreement under which the Bank wholly financed the importation of the 10 tractors. At pages 406-407 of the Record the Appellant strongly argued at the Court of Appeal that the learned High Court judge failed to distinguish between the loan agreement through which the Bank provided 100% funding for the importation of the ten tractors and the subsequent alleged tort of detinue and conversion committed.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"The Appellant further argued that if the High Court had drawn the distinction between the two it would have seen its way clear in upholding the legitimacy of the counterclaim for the outstanding debt especially after awarding the Respondent damages for the detinue and conversion. Equity fairness and justice require that the Respondent’s indebtedness should at least have been set off against the damages awarded him in order not to unjustly enrich the Respondent.” It is clear from my earlier discussion and holding in this judgment that I accept the main thrust of the bank’s argument on this point, namely, that its counterclaim should be upheld and that the seizing of the tractors, even if a breach of contract, did not release the company from its obligation to repay the debt. I would, in consequence, uphold ground (iv) of the appellant’s grounds of appeal. Ground (v), however, causes me some discomfort and I would not uphold it in the exact language through which it is expressed. Admittedly, the learned Justices of Appeal were in error in not addressing the issue of whether the bank’s conduct in seizing the tractors constituted a breach of contract and what were the consequences of that breach of contract.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"However, their error was not in failing to address the issue of whether “the tort of detinue and conversion allegedly committed by the Defendant/Appellant amounted to a repudiation of the loan contract”, as alleged in the ground of appeal. The learned trial judge had held the defendant bank liable in both contract and tort and it would have been right for the learned Justices of Appeal to have adverted to the issue of whether the bank’s conduct had indeed been a breach of the contract of loan. However, I do not accept the argument made by the bank in support of this ground of appeal to the effect that the High Court’s decision that there was a fundamental breach of the loan agreement was an error of law. I uphold the High Court’s decision that there was a fundamental breach of the loan agreement.

"To my mind, the consequence of the fundamental breach was the bank’s liability to pay damages and not the cancellation of the debt obligation owed to it by the plaintiff/respondent/respondent. This is an implication of the law explained above that discharge by breach does not relate back to set aside obligations that had accrued before the date of discharge. However, the damages payable, on the facts of this case, might only be nominal, because of the substantial damages awarded by the learned trial judge in respect of the tort liability of the appellant bank, unless there is evidence that the plaintiff has proven a loss not covered by the tort damages. Restitutio in integrum is the purpose of the award of contract damages and not unjust enrichment of the innocent party beyond restoring him or her to the position he or she would have been in if the breach had not taken place. Accordingly, in place of the learned trial judge’s cancellation of the plaintiff company’s debt obligation to the defendant bank, I would substitute nominal damages payable by the bank to the plaintiff/respondent/respondent company for the breach of the loan agreement, unless the Record discloses that the Plaintiff has proven substantial damages beyond the loss covered by the tort damages.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"Ground (vi) of the Appellant bank’s grounds of appeal reads as follows: “The learned Justices of Appeal erred by upholding the damages awarded by the trial Court in spite of the legal submissions made by the Defendant/Appellant and further by failing to properly take into account the outstanding debt admitted by the Plaintiff/Respondent from which the importation of the ten (10) tractors was financed.” The Appellant supports this ground with only one paragraph in its Statement of Case. That paragraph states: “Our main grievance on the above ground is the fact that the High Court after awarding such damages should have taken into consideration the outstanding debt owed by the Respondent and set it off against the damages so as not to unjustly enrich the Respondent because after all it was the Appellant that wholly paid for the ten tractors for the Respondent and yet ask him not to pay the loan is most unfair, unjust and unconscionable. The Court of Appeal therefore committed an error when it affirmed the High Court’s erroneous decision.” Apart from complaining about the High Court’s failure to take the plaintiff/respondent’s outstanding debt liability to the defendant/appellant into account, this ground of appeal does not appear to complain about the quantum and principles underlying the damages awarded by the High Court in tort. If it does, it is half-hearted.

"Subject to that, I would affirm the damages awarded by the learned trial judge. In explaining how he quantified the damages payable in respect of the conversion, he said (at pp. 281-2 of the Record): “For the moment I would deal with the assessment of damages in respect of the five tractors which the defendant bank refused to release for the use of the plaintiff company. A practical way of assessing the minimum value of the five tractors which were not put to use and remained in the custody of the defendant bank until they were disposed of would be to estimate what amount it cost the plaintiff company to procure all five of them.

"According to the evidence on record the purchase and importation of the ten tractors were wholly funded by monies provided by the bank. Therefore it would be reasonable in the circumstances to limit the minimum value to be placed on the ten tractors to the total indebtedness of the plaintiff company to the defendant bank.

It means therefore that the value of five of the Renault tractors would be half of the two amounts, which would be FF979,090.00 and c388.235.00 respectively. To me the total of the two amounts would be adequate compensation for the plaintiffs in the nature of damages for the conversion committed by the defendant bank in respect of the five tractors which it refused to release to the plaintiff company after their unjustifiable and unwarranted seizure.” In relation to the remaining five tractors which were released to the plaintiffs, the learned trial judge explained his quantification of damages in relation to them as follows (at p.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"284 of the Record): “…they were entitled to the award of damages for conversion which would be equal to the value of the five tractors at the time of their sale. Unlike the five tractors which were not released, it would not be relatively easy to compute their value at the time of sale, especially when no evidence was led by the plaintiff company in that regard. That, of course, is understandable since the plaintiffs’ pleading did not anticipate that the court would treat the five tractors which were not released differently from the other five. To be on a safe side we just have to limit our assessment of the value of the five tractors, which were used for some time, to the total amount which was derived from their sale at the instance of the defendant company.” An issue which arises from the learned trial judge’s quantification of the tort damages is whether after the award of those damages, there is any room left for the award of further damages, whether in contract or in tort. In tort, an argument could be made in support of consequential loss of profit by the plaintiff company caused by the commission of the tort.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"The difficulty for the plaintiff is that such consequential loss of profit has to be proved. Moreover, the plaintiff did not cross-appeal against the quantum of tort damages awarded it. Alternatively, the plaintiff could rely on contract to recover further damages flowing from the fact that the bank’s unlawful seizure of the plaintiff’s chattels, in breach of contract, probably caused it to lose profit. The first problem for a court seeking to award supplementary contract damages on this score is that the plaintiff did not sue in contract. However, the defendant bank did counter-claim in contract.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"Thus, in determining whether the plaintiff’s liability under the loan contract to the defendant bank remains outstanding, the issue can be legitimately addressed as to whether any loss, beyond that in relation to which tort compensation had already been awarded, had been caused to the plaintiff by the defendant’s breach of the contract of loan such that that loss should be deducted from the plaintiff’s indebtedness to the defendant bank. In principle, it is reasonable to hold that the plaintiff’s indebtedness under the contract of loan should be reduced by the monetary value of any breaches of that contract by the defendant bank. In this regard, the main loss raised by the evidence on record relates to the plaintiff’s probable loss of profits from the use of the five tractors that were never released to them, in consequence of the defendant bank’s breach of contract. Can this be quantified and how is it to be quantified? Because the plaintiff did not sue in contract, it did not lead evidence of any loss of profits from being denied the use of the five tractors that were not released to it.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

That makes the task of quantifying loss of profit difficult. The failure to lead evidence on loss of profits also raises the issue of whether this court is precluded from awarding substantial damages in respect of the defendant bank’s breach of the contract of loan.

"That case also dealt with how to measure damages for a breach of contract resulting in loss of use of a chattel, in that particular case for a week.

"But those cases are no authority for the proposition that, if the owner of a profit-earning chattel does not prove the loss he has sustained, the judge may make a guess in the dark and award him some arbitrary sum.” The court, therefore, set aside the trial judge’s award of 250 pounds as damages for the plaintiffs’ loss of use of their machinery because of the defendants’ delivery of the machinery a week late in breach of contract. The court, however, did go on to award damages under the following principles (at p. 748): “The machine here was a chattel of commercial value, but on the facts before us there are only four possible heads of damage: (1) depreciation which was running on, (2) interest on the money invested which was being wasted, (3) some trivial amount of maintenance which was no doubt involved, (4) some expenditure of wages which were thrown away.” The total amount of damages awarded by the court under these heads was in total 14 pounds. This case illustrates that, in the absence of evidence of loss of profits, a court may assess some damages under the four heads mentioned above, but those damages should be modest, though more than nominal.

"The Appellant relied on the well-known case of Dam v Addo \[1962\] 2 GLR 200 to sustain its argument. In that case, Adumua-Bossman JSC, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court, said (at p. 203): “The process of consideration and weighing up of the respective cases of the parties by which the learned judge arrived at the conclusion at which he did arrive, would appear to have involved the substitution by him proprio motu of a case substantially different from, and inconsistent with, the case put forward by the respondents and the ultimate acceptance by him of that substituted case which was not the respondents’ case at all. This acceptance in favour of a party of a case different from and inconsistent with that which he himself has put forward in and by his pleadings, has been consistently held to be unjustifiable and fundamentally wrong both by the English superior courts and our local superior courts.” The issue is whether this principle is relevant to the facts of this case. Whilst, undoubtedly Quaye JA discussed the legal issue of the consolidation of the loans disclosed by the evidence in this case, it would not appear that the legal issue raised in it was inconsistent with the case put forward by the plaintiff company in the High Court, as my discussion earlier in this case has shown.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

Whilst it is desirable and prudent for an appellate court to invite arguments on propositions of law it intends to rely on other than those canvassed by the parties before it, there is no absolute bar on an appellate court from deciding a case on the basis of such a proposition of law. In any case, what occasioned the miscarriage of justice, through the application of the proposition of law relating to the consolidation of the loans, in this case was its perpetuation of the learned trial judge’s error in refusing to enforce the plaintiff company’s admitted indebtedness, rather than the lack of notice of the legal gloss in the argument adopted by Quaye JA.

"I also agree he has carefully and fairly dealt with the un-treaded issue of concurrent causes of action in tort and contract in our jurisdiction; I agree with his conclusion that the appeal before us be dismissed in part. With the above, there would not be any need for me to say anything more except perhaps only to add some few words in further support. I shall limit myself to the issue of contact obligations as far as loans are concerned just to lend further support to what has been said already. The case of Barclays Bank Ghana Ltd v Sakari 1997-98 1 GLR 746, SC, is worthy of mention.

"However, without the consent of the plaintiff, the defendant used the loan to purchase a Saurer tanker instead of the Mercedes Benz trucks. A week after the purchase of the tanker, it was seized by the government on the ground that Saurer trucks were to be operated exclusively by the State and not individuals. After repeated unsuccessful demands by the plaintiff on the defendant to repay the loan, the plaintiff brought an action against him at the High Court, Tamale, for, inter alia, recovery of the loan plus the accrued interest thereon. In his defence, the defendant contended that the unexpected seizure of the Saurer tanker by the government had frustrated the loan agreement and had thereby discharged him his obligations under the contract. The trial High Court found that it was a term of the loan agreement that the defendant was to operate the Saurer tanker and repay the loan from its proceeds.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"It therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s claims on the ground that the loan transaction had been frustrated by the seizure of the Saurer tanker by the government. On appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed by a two to one majority decision. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court against the majority decision of the Court of Appeal.” The Supreme Court allowed the appeal. While the court held that the events leading to the seizure of the vehicles did not amount to frustration it nonetheless addressed the issue of the supposed frustration of the contract vis-�-vis the obligations to the parties under the contract, Acquah JSC as he then was held thus: “Now what is the obligation created under this loan contract, a breach of which would entitle the other to sue? The obligation of the bank was to advance the money which it did and that of the defendant was to repay the loan together with interest if any.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

"This is the obligation of the parties under this loan contract, and indeed almost all loan contracts. When a bank lends money to its customer, the obligation of the customer is to repay the loan….Thus the obligation of a borrower in a loan contract as opposed to other types of contracts is to repay the loan and not the performance of the purpose for which the loan was sought.” In my view, the above case applies mutatis mutandis to the issue of the appellant’s counterclaim which had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal to the effect that the seizure of the respondent’s tractors by the appellant bank did not release the respondent company of its primary obligation under the loan contract. In this case, the respondent owed the appellant an obligation to repay the loan, whether or not there was a breach occasioned by the appellant. The primary obligation to repay the loan had not changed and its obligation was not dependent on the performance of the purpose of the loan or a breach of contract by the appellant bank. The issue of the quantum of damages for breach has been dealt with by my learned brother and I have nothing to add in that regard.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'APPEALJ4/25/201125', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['L.N.S.

Order 25 rule 1(1) thus gives discretionary power to the Court to grant an injunction where it deems it just and convenient to do so.

The main ground canvassed by counsel for Defendant/Respondent/Applicant herein in seeking to set aside the order granting the injunction is that this court was not seised with jurisdiction because as at the 20th day of December 2012, when this court granted the injunction the record of appeal had not been transmitted to this court and Form 6 had not been issued by the Registrar of the court below, that is the High Court, Fast Track Division. We are being called upon, in this application, to examine the conduct of this court as it sat on the 20th December 2012, to ascertain whether it had jurisdiction to grant the injunction. In other words we are to ascertain whether the court erred in granting the application for injunction pending an appeal against the refusal of an injunction by a lower court in the peculiar circumstances of the case, when the record of appeal had not been transmitted to this court.

"It is trite learning that an appeal is a creature of Statute and an appellate jurisdiction can only be exercised when the appellant has brought himself/herself within the law creating the appeal. In Frimpong v. Poku(1962) 2 GLR 1 at 6 the Supreme Court held thus:- “A right of appeal is always conferred by statute, and when the statute conferring the right lays down conditions precedent to the raising of that right in a litigant, it is essential that those conditions must be strictly performed otherwise that right does not become vested.” An appeal is deemed to be entered at the Court of Appeal when Form 6 is issued by the Registrar of the court below. The issuance of Form 6 means that the records of appeal are transmitted from the trial court to the Court of Appeal. There is no dispute in law as to when an appeal is deemed to have been entered in the appellate court as the authorities are legion on this matter.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': 'CIVIL MOTION'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2014-02-20T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2014, 'month': 'February', 'day': 20}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'ACQUAYE, JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2014\\MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.', 'short': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'}}"

The facts of this case are that the Plaintiff/Appellant/Respondent applied for an interlocutory injunction at the High Court/Fast Track Division and was refused. The Respondent herein then filed an appeal in this court against the order refusing the injunction on 29th July 2012. The Respondent filed an application for an interim injunction pending the final determination of the appeal against the order refusing the injunction.

"It is this order that the Applicant herein seeks to set aside on grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to so make the order. What then is the jurisdiction of this court to entertain interlocutory applications? This court’s jurisdiction on interlocutory applications is clearly defined by Rules 21, 27A and 28 of C1 19, which provides as follows: “21. Control of Proceedings during Pendency of Appeal: ‘’ after the record of appeal has been transmitted from the court below to the court, the court shall be seised of the whole of the proceedings as between the parties and every application shall be made to the court and not to the court below, but an application may be filed in the court below for transmission to the court.” In reviewing the above Rule in the context of the instant proceedings, it is clear that the Respondent’s application for interim injunction which was granted by this court could not have been prosecuted under Rule 21, since at the time of the application the record of appeal had not been transmitted from the court below to this court. What does Rules 27 A and 28 provide?","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': 'CIVIL MOTION'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2014-02-20T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2014, 'month': 'February', 'day': 20}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'ACQUAYE, JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2014\\MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.', 'short': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'}}"
"Rule 27 A: Interlocutory Appeals. “The court may in an interlocutory appeal civil or criminal before it grant a stay of proceedings pending the determination of the interlocutory appeal subject to the conditions the court considers fit.” Again under this rule the only application that this court is mandated to grant is one of stay of proceedings and not an order of interim injunction. Rule 27A is followed by Rule 28 which is titled “Court to which application should be made” and provides as follows: “28. Subject to these Rules and to any other enactment, where under an enactment, an application may be made to the court below or to the court, it shall be made in the first instance to the court below, but if the court below refuses to grant the application, the applicant is entitled to have the application determined by the court.” The above rule 28 is speaking to what is commonly referred to in our civil procedure practice as repeat applications. Our understanding of the rule is that before an application could be repeated in the court of appeal after its refusal by the court below an enactment must give right to the repetition of the application.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': 'CIVIL MOTION'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2014-02-20T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2014, 'month': 'February', 'day': 20}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'ACQUAYE, JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2014\\MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.', 'short': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'}}"
"Few examples of such applications that specific enactments sanction the right to repeat in the Court of Appeal are as follows: (a)Application for Stay of Execution when an appeal is filed (b)Motion for extension of time to file an appeal against a final judgment and (c)Motion for leave to appeal against the interlocutory order of the Circuit Court. It is important to state that by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Republic v. Fast Track High Court, Accra, Exparte Daniel Kwasi Abodakpi, Civil Motion No. JS/15/2005 dated 25th October 2005, the High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain application of stay of proceedings so there can’t be a repeat application to the Court of Appeal, since the application must now be made directly to the Court of Appeal. Flowing from the requirement in Rule 28 we do not know of any enactment which stipulates that if an application for interlocutory injunction is refused by a trial court and an appeal is taken the application can be repeated as of right.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': None, 'type': 'CIVIL MOTION'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2014-02-20T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2014, 'month': 'February', 'day': 20}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'ACQUAYE, JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2014\\MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.', 'short': 'MOKAB COMPANY GHANA LTD.'}}"
"No such enactment has been referred to us by counsel for the Respondent who is opposing the instant application.

As observed the application for interim injunction could also not be taken as a repeat application since no enactment gives that right to the Respondent herein.

The remedy that the Respondent was seeking upon the determination of the appeal is a decree of interlocutory injunction against the Applicant herein.

"Both appealed against their convictions. In the Supreme Court it was argued among others that there was no evidence of an agreement between the appellants and that since the only evidence adduced was in respect of the substantive charge of fraud by false pretences, it was irregular to include in the charge a count of conspiracy. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal stating unequivocally that: - “In the opinion of the Court, the Ghana law of conspiracy is wider in scope and in content than the English law on the subject. It consists not only in the criminal agreement between two minds, but also in the acting together in furtherance of a common criminal offence.” P.

"Twumasi, in his Book “Criminal Law in Ghana” at page 106 thereof reiterates the position as follows:- “Our law is wider in the sense that while it is essential to prove a previous agreement in all cases of conspiracy in English law a person may be convicted in Ghana for conspiracy even though there is no proof of such previous agreement. To succeed in a charge of conspiracy the prosecution may prove either (1) That the accused agreed together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime Or (2)That the accused persons acted together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime”. 7\. From the evidence in the Record of Appeal, the Prosecution proved overt acts by the appellant and his accomplice at large which showed that they acted together with a common purpose to commit the criminal offence of robbery by these incidents:- �The appellant was a pillion rider on a motor driven by his accomplice (page three (3) of the Record of Appeal �The complainant (PW1 Samuel Frimpong) and the Security Guard (PW2 Kwasi Boateng) at pages 9 and 10 of the Record of Appeal respectively stated that both the appellant and his accomplice ordered the complainant to hand over the phone to them and that they pointed rifles on the complainant and the customer who went to buy the phone units.

"The appellant denied the allegation against him and said that since he was not at the scene of the crime at all, the witnesses were mistaken. The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant was one of the robbers. The jury accepted the evidence of the prosecution and he was consequently convicted and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment with hard labour. He appealed on the main ground that the sentence was excessive and also that there was insufficient evidence of his identity. In dismissing the appeal, the court held per holding (1) that “where the identity of an accused person is in issue, there can be no better proof of his identity than the evidence of a witness who swears to have seen the accused committing the offence charged.” 9\.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H2/06/2015', 'type': 'CRIMINAL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['BABA MOHAMMED VRS.

"This direct evidence was not of concern to the appellant and his counsel. Their beef was that no medical report was tendered at the trial to indicate that the injury to the eye was from a gunshot and that no ballistic expert was called as a witness to testify that the injury to the eye of the appellant was shot from the gun of the Security Guard. Relying on circumstantial evidence is not new to the law. The only constraint is that for circumstantial evidence to succeed in the conviction of an accused person, it must point to one and only one conclusion.

It is worthy of note that the appellant changed the story of the injury to his eye but eventually settled on gunshot injury when he was confronted with the medical finding backed by the X-ray report. At page 4 of the Record of Appeal the appellant told the medical officer that he was hurt by an iron rod. When this did not work, he told the doctor that he fought with a friend who shot him in the eye (See page 16 of the Record of Appeal) but he failed to go and identify that friend to the Police.

When PW2 also testified that he shot the accused, he did not challenge him. It is thus our considered opinion that these circumstances lead to the irresistible and inevitable conclusion that the eye injury was as a result of the gun shot fired by PW2 and for that reason any other witnesses, whether medical officer and or ballistic expert would have been surplusage. The accused himself ultimately admitted that the injury to his eye was from a gunshot.

"14\. GROUND (c) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL: The sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment with hard labour is harsh in the light of the circumstances of the case. Counsel for the appellant acknowledged the position of the law that the sentence a court may impose on an accused person either at a trial or on appeal is entirely within the discretion of the court. It is also not in dispute that where an appellant complains about the harshness of a sentence, he ought to appreciate that every sentence is supposed to serve a five-fold purpose, namely, to be punitive, calculated to deter others, to reform the offender, to appease the society and to be a safe-guard to the country. See the case of MOHAMMED KAMIL V THE REPUBLIC (2011) 30 GMJ I SC Counsel however relied on the case of KWAKU FRIMPONG @ IBOMAN V THE REPUBLIC (2012) 1 SCGLR 297 where the Supreme Court stated that “It is also generally accepted that a first offender must normally be given a second opportunity to reform and play his or her role in society as a useful and law abiding citizen” and put in a plea of mitigation for the appellant.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H2/06/2015', 'type': 'CRIMINAL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['BABA MOHAMMED VRS.

"He said the appellant was 18 years at the time of his arrest in April 2006; had no criminal record at that time and that even though the appellant and his accomplice were armed, there was no loss of lives or injuries to the victim. The case of KWASHIE V THE REPUBLIC (1971) 1 GLR 448 is very pertinent here. In this case, in collaboration with two other police officers, the first appellant used his office as a police detective to seize a large quantity of goods that had been smuggled into the country. Rather than sending the goods to the police station they were sent to the private house of one of the accomplices for the purpose of selling them for the benefit of all who participated. The appellants and their accomplices were found guilty of stealing and were each sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H2/06/2015', 'type': 'CRIMINAL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['BABA MOHAMMED VRS.

"Counsel for the first appellant argued that the sentence was excessive, submitting among others: (1) that the trial judge gave no reasons for the severe sentence that he passed on the first appellant; (2) that having regard to the value of the goods stolen the sentence was excessive and (3) that the first appellant was a first offender and ought to have been more leniently dealt with. The court dismissed the appeal holding among others that: “(1) When a trial judge is imposing a sentence on a convicted person there is no obligation on him to give reasons for the sentence that he passes. (2) Since the offence was of a very grave nature, the sentence must not only have been punitive but it must also have been deterrent or exemplary in order to mark the disapproval of society of such conduct by police officers. When a court decides to impose a deterrent sentence the value of the subject-matter of the charge and the good record of the accused become irrelevant.” Concerning the length of sentence, it was stated at page 493 thus: - “in determining the length of sentence, the factors which the trial judge is entitled to consider are:- (i)The intrinsic seriousness of the offence (ii)The degree of revulsion felt by law abiding citizens of the society for the particular crime. (iii)The premeditation with which the criminal plan was executed (iv)The prevalence of the crime within the particular locality (v)The sudden increase in the incident of the particular crime” 15\.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H2/06/2015', 'type': 'CRIMINAL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['BABA MOHAMMED VRS.

"No one will deny that taking another person’s mobile phone at gun point is a serious or grave offence and no one will also deny that law abiding citizens abhor and detest robbery. The incidence of mobile phone snatching is quite prevalent in the country and was definitely on the increase at the time this offence was committed. The modus operandi of the appellant and his accomplice at large, namely, using a motor cycle in order to get away fast shows some strategic planning on their part. That being the case, we think the trial judge exercised his discretion rightly in his sentencing of the appellant. His sentence is in line with the case of ADU-BOAHEN VRS THE REPUBLIC cited supra where court also held that: - “Where the court finds an offence to be grave, it must not only impose a punitive sentence, but also a deterrent or exemplary one so as to indicate the disapproval of society of that offence.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H2/06/2015', 'type': 'CRIMINAL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['BABA MOHAMMED VRS.

"Once the court decides to impose a deterrent sentence the good record of the accused is irrelevant”. 16\. The principle of sentencing is not just dictated by case law alone. There are clear and unambiguous statutory provisions on the ambit of sentences. Section 149(1) of Act 29/60 as amended by S 150 of Act 646 of 2003, the applicable law at the time of the commission of the offences in this case stipulates as follows:- (1) whoever commits robbery is guilty of an offence and shall be liable, upon conviction on a trial summarily or on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not less than ten years, and where the offence is committed by the use of an offensive weapon or offensive missile, the offender shall upon conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than fifteen years.” It is to be noted that the applicable law provided a minimum sentence of 15 years where the offence is committed by the use of an offensive weapon, guns in this instance, and provides no upper limit.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H2/06/2015', 'type': 'CRIMINAL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['', ''], 'combinedParties': ['BABA MOHAMMED VRS.

"Also as held by the Supreme Court in Odonkor vs. Amartei \[supra\] the basic purpose of interim orders was, as much as possible, to hold the balance evenly between the parties, pending a final resolution of matters in difference between them, and also to ensure that at the end of the day the successful party did not find that his victory was an empty one.

"The two grounds of appeal filed by the Defendant are as follows: “1. The judgment is against the weight of evidence on record. 2\. That the learned trial Judge was wrong when she held – “once the defendant assign a reason “unsatisfactory work performance” when the defendant assumed the burden of proving same on balance of probabilities. This, the defendant woefully failed to do” and that error occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice.” I shall discuss the two grounds of appeal together as both of them require the Court to evaluate the entire evidence on record and come to the conclusion the trial Judge did not properly discuss either the facts or the law or both, and if the errors are corrected, the judgment should be overturned.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/03/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['ASANTE – ANSONG FOR THE APPELLANT', 'NAMOO FOR THE RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['ASANTE – ANSONG'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['NAMOO']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'KOFORIDUA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2015, 'month': 'March', 'day': 11}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'DENNIS D ADJEI JA  PRESIDING', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2015\\FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D', 'short': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'}}"
"Where there are evidence that the facts were not properly discussed and if they are properly discussed and evaluated the errors to be corrected, may overturn the judgment, the appeal should succeed. On the other hand, where the errors are corrected and would not disturb the judgment, the appeal should fail. Where a court is setting aside a judgment, on the premise that the judgment is against the evidence on record, the court must satisfy itself that the mistakes to be corrected arising from the improper evaluation of the facts should be a genuine one and not fanciful errors. In the case in point the Appellant’s concern is that the trial Judge held that an employer who terminates the employee’s employment is not required to assign reason but where he assigns reasons he should be able to justify it. The Defendant disagrees with the above statement made by the trial court which influenced its decision and the correct position of the law should be restated.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/03/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['ASANTE – ANSONG FOR THE APPELLANT', 'NAMOO FOR THE RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['ASANTE – ANSONG'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['NAMOO']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'KOFORIDUA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2015, 'month': 'March', 'day': 11}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'DENNIS D ADJEI JA  PRESIDING', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2015\\FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D', 'short': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'}}"
"The trial Judge made the following reliefs after having discussed the evidence on record; “In conclusion, this court makes the following orders: 1.The Defendant should pay each Plaintiff, except the eight, fifteen months salary as compensation or damages for wrongful termination or dismissal. 2.The Defendant is also to pay to each Plaintiff with the exception of the eight Plaintiffs, all entitlements if any under the contract of employment which were due or earned by the Plaintiffs but which remain unpaid by the Defendant.” A look at the relief (1) granted by the trial court reveals that the trial Judge could not draw a distinction between wrongful termination and dismissal. The fifteen months salary as compensation was awarded by her for “wrongful termination or dismissal.” There are difference among dismissal, wrongful termination and unfair termination and if the trial Judge should have used the terminologies correctly, she would have settled on what the compensation of fifteen months was meant for. Dismissal is where an employee’s appointment has been truncated based on his behavior. Where the employee is dismissed contrary to the breach of the rule of natural justice or the collective agreement or a statute, he is said to have been unlawfully dismissed.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/03/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['ASANTE – ANSONG FOR THE APPELLANT', 'NAMOO FOR THE RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['ASANTE – ANSONG'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['NAMOO']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'KOFORIDUA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2015, 'month': 'March', 'day': 11}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'DENNIS D ADJEI JA  PRESIDING', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2015\\FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D', 'short': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'}}"

"2011 2 SCGLR is authority for the proposition that the provisions of sections 62 & 63 of the said Act are directed at the Labour Commission and not the Courts and that the recourse of a person who complains of unfair termination is not a claim for damages before the courts but a complaint before the Labour Commission. On the basis of this my esteemed brother and sister take the position that the trial Court “lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the termination was fair or unfair”. It is clear from page 150 of the Record of Appeal that the Judge was in no doubt that she had no jurisdiction to make such a determination.

Her conclusion that the termination of the appointments of the plaintiffs was wrongful and unfair was because she took the position that the Defendants, having failed to prove the alleged unsatisfactory work performance and the plaintiffs having on the other hand led evidence of satisfactory work by tendering promotion letters, best worker award, etc.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/03/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['ASANTE – ANSONG FOR THE APPELLANT', 'NAMOO FOR THE RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['ASANTE – ANSONG'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['NAMOO']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'KOFORIDUA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2015, 'month': 'March', 'day': 11}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'DENNIS D ADJEI JA  PRESIDING', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2015\\FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D', 'short': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'}}"
the balance of probabilities favoured the latter. What are the consequences of the finding that the balance of possibilities favour the plaintiffs? I am satisfied that this finding means that the evidence supports a case of wrongful termination. As already stated the plaintiffs had sought damages for unfair termination – (an award the trial court would not have had jurisdiction to make) what the court awarded was damages for wrongful termination or dismissal.

A reference has been made to the case of DAM VS. J.K. ADDO BROTHERS (1962) 2 GLR 2000where the Supreme Court held that a court must not substitute a case or accept a case which is contrary to what a party has put forward. I am satisfied from the evidence that the case put forward by the plaintiffs is one of wrongful termination of appointment. That being so are the plaintiffs to be denied recompense because they make a claim for compensation for unfair termination of employment rather than seeking to be compensated for wrongful termination?,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/03/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['ASANTE – ANSONG FOR THE APPELLANT', 'NAMOO FOR THE RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['ASANTE – ANSONG'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['NAMOO']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'KOFORIDUA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2015-03-11T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2015, 'month': 'March', 'day': 11}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS'], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'presidingJudge': 'DENNIS D ADJEI JA  PRESIDING', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2015\\FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D', 'short': 'FAUSTINA ASANTEWAA _ 7 OTHERS VS.THE REGISTERED TRUSTEES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, KOFORIDUA D'}}"
I think not. This is a Court of law as well as equity. It also exercises its jurisdiction “by way of rehearing”. The courts go to extreme lengths to do justice rather than insisting on form.

"Gihoc Refrigeration (2007-2008) SCGLR 16 that where a judicial relief is clearly established by the evidence led by a defendant, the proper and fair thing to do will be to grant him the said relief, I feel no hesitation in changing the damages awarded by the trial court for “wrongful termination or dismissal” to damages for wrongful termination. Admittedly that case dealt with the question of whether a defendant who had not filed a counterclaim deserved a judicial relief supported by her evidence. I see no reason why a plaintiff should not be entitled to the same consideration. Interestingly there is no appeal by the defendants against the damages awarded in this case.

The issue according to counsel, is who are the rightful persons to exercise the powers of the plaintiff Company.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"

"Amatei (1987-1988) GLR 578 stated as follows: “ We are of the opinion that the Court of Appeal did not propose to lay down any hard and fast rule or principles to regulate the determination of interlocutory injunctions. Even though it is discretionary, we are of the view that a trial court in determining interlocutory applications must first consider whether the case of the applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had a legal or equitable right which a Court should protect. Second, the court is also enjoined to ensure that the status quo is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. The trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardship to the other party”. From the provision of Order 25 rule 1 and the authorities, an injunction is a discretionary relief and a court or judge in determining an application for injunction must exercise his discretion judiciously and not capriciously or arbitrarily.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"
"The court must also determine whether the applicant has demonstrated that he has a right at law or in equity to be protected. The court must also consider the balance of convenience whilst maintaining the status quo. The evidence shows that the plaintiff Company is a company limited by guarantee and the law is settled that even though a company has a legal personality and exists independently of its members, it acts through individuals ie physical persons, usually through its members in general meetings or its board of directors or officers as set out in section 137(1) to (5) of the Companies Act 1963 (Act 179) which provide as follows: 1)A company shall act through its members in general meeting or its board of directors or through officers or agents, appointed by or under authority derived from the members in general meetings or board of directors. 2)Subject to the provisions of this code, the respective powers of the members in general meeting and the board of directors shall be determined by the company’s Regulations 3)Except as otherwise provided in the Company’s Regulations the business of the Company shall be managed by the board of directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Code or the Regulations required to be exercised by the members in general meeting. 4)Notwithstanding the provisions of sub section (3) of this section the members in general meeting may a)Act in any matter if the members of the board of directors are disqualified or unable to act by reason of a deadlock on the board or otherwise b)Institute legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company if the board of directors refuse or neglect to do so c)Ratify or confirm any action taken by the board of directors, or d)Make recommendations to the board of directors regarding action to be taken by the board.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"
"5)No alteration of the Regulations shall invalidate any prior act of the board of directors which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made”. Looking at the reliefs being sought by the plaintiff in this action and those being sought by the 1st to 7th defendants in their counterclaim, it is obvious that the real and fundamental issue for determination in the suit at the trial court is the issue of who are the rightful persons to exercise the power of the plaintiff Company that is to say is it the persons who instituted the action using the name of the plaintiff Company or the 1st to 7th defendants? There is as a corollary to this issue, the question of who are the rightful person to have control and access to the plaintiff Company’s funds being held by the 8th and 9th defendants ie Republic Bank and GT Bank. The trial judge in my view correctly fixed his sights on that issue when he stated in his ruling as follows at page 325 of the Record thus: “Now having regard to the competing claims of the parties and given the affidavit evidence and facts of the case it is clear that the respective cases have a single strand running through them and it is who has the right to control the heart and soul of the company called Indepth Network. After considering the allegations and counter allegations of forgery and illegality levelled by the parties against each other and after considering the issue of whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable damage and inconvenience if the application is refused, the trial judge again stated as follows: “ As noted earlier on, who has the right to control the plaintiff Company is the centerpiece of this litigation and therefore this Court ought to avoid making any definite findings at this moment in time.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"
"With that in mind and on the balance of convenience, I hold that it shall not be just and convenient to grant either the plaintiffs request for an injunctive order nor that of the 1st to 7th defendants application ……….. Order 25 rule 1(1) empowers the Court in dealing with an application for an order of interlocutory injunction to make an order either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers just …… Accordingly, I order that pending the final trial and determination of this suit and starting from today, both parties being the plaintiff and 1st to 7th Respondents are hereby restrained from making orders to the 8th and 9th Respondents to release funds to them” The trial judge then made an order for a timely and speedy adjudication of the matter by ordering the plaintiff to file a reply if need be and take out application for Directions within 14 days for the case to proceed to an early trial. It is this decision of the trial judge that is the subject of this appeal and the plaintiff/appellant has in all the grounds of appeal and the written submissions attacked the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion. It is worth pointing out that the funds which the parties are fighting over are donor funds. The record of appeal shows that the plaintiff company Indepth Network receives funds from donors to undertake its activities.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"

"Viscount Simon stated the established rule of law in an appeal against the exercise of the Courts discretion as follows: “ An appeal against the exercise of the courts discretion can only succeed on the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate materials if it can be shown that the court acted under a misapprehension of fact in that it either gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into account; but the appeal is not from the discretion of the court to the discretion of the appellate court” This decision in Blunt Vs. Blunt (supra) was applied in the case of Crentstil Vs. Crentsil (1962) 2 GLR 171 at 175 where the Supreme Court held per Sarkodie Addo JSC that: “As to appeals from the exercise of the courts discretion, it is a rule of law deep-rooted and well established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of the Court’s discretion save in exceptional circumstances”. Also in the case of Sappor Vs. Wigatap Ltd (2007-2008) 1 SCGLR 676 at 677 the Supreme Court held as follows in holding 2 thereof thus: “ The well known and time honoured legal principle is that an appeal against a decision based on the exercise of a court’s discretionary jurisdiction, would succeed in only those clearly exceptional cases where in sum the judge failed to act judicially.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"
"The applicable principles are; an appellate court would interfere with the exercise of the discretion where the court below applied wrong principles or the conclusions reached would work manifest injustice or even that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate material. Arbitrary, capricious and uninformed conclusions stand in danger of being reversed on appeal” The fundamental question for determination in this appeal is whether the appellant succeeded in establishing all the factors necessary to prove that the trial Court exercised its discretion wrongly. We are of the view that having gone through the record of appeal and the written submissions of counsel, that the trial judge exercised his discretion properly and took into consideration all the relevant matters and came to the correct conclusions. Before we are done we must refer to relief (f) of the plaintiff’s claim wherein it asked for “ (f) An order compelling the 8th and 9th defendants to allow the plaintiff company to have access to its accounts”. In the application for an order of interlocutory injunction, dated 7th June 2018 the plaintiff sought amongst the interim reliefs, “(e) An order of mandatory injunction compelling the 8th and 9th defendants to allow the plaintiff Company to have access to its accounts” Clearly if the trial judge had granted interim relief (e), that would have amounted to a determination of relief (f) as endorsed on the plaintiffs writ of summons.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H1/86/2020', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['Nana Adjei Baffour with Theresa Tasi for Plaintiff/Appellant', 'Naa Adjeley Dzane for the 1st-7th Defendants/Respondents'], 'combinedParties': ['INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['Nana Adjei Baffour', 'Theresa Tasi'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['Naa Adjeley Dzane']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'COURT OF APPEAL'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2020-05-27T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2020, 'month': 'May', 'day': 27}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['INDEPTH NETWORK'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DANIEL KOFI BA']}, 'presidingJudge': 'DARKO ASARE JA', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Court of Apppeal\\2020\\INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA.htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'INDEPTH NETWORK VS DANIEL KOFI BA', 'short': 'INDEPTH NETWORK vs DANIEL KOFI BA'}}"

Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated. It is important to emphasise the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. It is this need for finality and definiteness which leads to the analytical need for the concept of invitation to treat. If a communication during negotiations is not the final expression of an alleged offeror’s willingness to be bound, it may be interpreted as an invitation to the other party to use it as a basis for formulating a proposal emanating from him or her that is definite enough to qualify as an offer.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"Thus the indefinite communication may be what generates an offer from the other side.

"93 states that: “A communication by which a party is invited to make an offer is commonly called an invitation to treat. It is distinguishable from an offer primarily on the ground that it is not made with the intention that it is to become binding as soon as the person to whom it is addressed simply communicates his assent to its terms.” A case relied on by the appellant, Gibson v Manchester City Council \[1979\] 1 All ER 972, is illustrative of a communication during “negotiations” which was not definite and final enough to be treated as an offer and therefore was rightly categorized as an invitation to treat. The case involved the tenant of a council house in Manchester, England, who wanted to buy the house from the council. In the middle of the process for the purchase of the property, following local government elections in May 1971, the local council changed its policy and decided not to proceed with the sale of any house in respect of which there had not yet been an exchange of contracts. The correspondence between the tenant and the council before this reversal of policy was as follows: After the city council had adopted a policy of selling houses to its tenants, the City Treasurer, following a request made by the tenant in this case for details of the price of the house he was renting and the mortgage terms available, had written on 10th February 1971 to the tenant stating that the council “may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price 2,725 pounds less 20% - 2,180 pounds (freehold).” The letter then set out the mortgage terms likely to be made available and continued: “If you would like to make formal application to buy your Council house please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible.” Accordingly, the tenant duly completed an application form with the heading “Application to buy a council house”, except that he did not fill in the purchase price, and returned it to the council.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"The form concluded with the statement: “I…now wish to purchase my Council house. The above answers are correct and I agree that they shall be the basis of the arrangements regarding the purchase…” The tenant followed up his application form a few days later with a letter dated 18th March 1971 in which he said: “I would be obliged if you will carry on with the purchase as per my application already in your possession.” Before contracts for the house could be exchanged, the May elections intervened which led to the reversal of the council’s policy on sales of houses to tenants, to which we have already alluded. The council subsequently wrote to the tenant to advise him that his application for a purchase of a council house could not be processed any further. When the tenant contended that the City Treasurer’s letter of February 1971 was an offer and that his completed application form of March 1971 was an acceptance and he therefore brought action for specific performance of the contract, the House of Lords held that the City Treasurer’s letter was at most an invitation to treat and that it was the tenant’s application form which was rather the offer.

This is in marked contrast with the facts of this case where the letter from the defendant/respondent/appellant proposed the sale to the plaintiff of an identified property at a price certain. What was left to be communicated were the details of the bank account into which the price was to be paid. This was a subsidiary question which did not affect the finality of what we construe to be the offer contained in the letter. The appellant also strenuously sought to make a distinction between the language construed to be an offer in Fofie v Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475 and the language in the present case. This contention was in rebuttal of the view taken by the Court of Appeal that the decision in the Fofie case should lead to the letter of 17 th January 2005 being construed as an offer.,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"Marful-Sau JA had said in the court below, after quoting the text of the offer in the Fofie case, that: “Indeed comparing the above letter which was held to be a valid offer to Exhibit A in the instant appeal it will be untenable to hold that Exhibit A is not a valid offer. The above letter suggested that should the offeree indicate his acceptance, a further meeting was to be held, yet the Supreme Court affirmed the holding by both the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal that it was a valid offer.” In the Fofie case, what the plaintiff contended was an offer was in the following terms: “…I am prepared to offer the house to you for sale. The selling price is c75,000. If this is acceptable to you, please confirm to enable us hold a meeting with your solicitor on the matter. Hoping to hear from you soon.” The learned trial judge, Lutterodt J, as she then was, and the Court of Appeal construed this language to be a valid offer.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"The disagreement in that case between the Court of Appeal and the trial judge was as to whether there had been any acceptance of this offer. The appellant in the present case in its Statement of Case argues that the distinction between what was construed to be an offer in the Fofie case and the alleged offer in this case lies in the fact that the parties in the Fofie case had had an earlier discussion and the quotation set out above was from a confirmatory letter. The appellant’s argument is set out as follows in its Statement of Case (para. 14): “The said Exhibit B was thus written in furtherance of the earlier discussions between the parties and was only to formalize the earlier discussion. It is on this basis that all the Courts from the High Court through to the Supreme Court, took the position that Exhibit B, the confirmation letter, was an offer.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"This is clearly distinguishable from this case where there is no evidence on record that the Parties had had any initial discussion on the subject and that Exhibit A herein was a confirmation of any such previous discussion. My Lords, being “prepared to offer … for sale” is very different from “proposing to sell!! It is therefore faltering, with respect, to say that the instant case is on all fours with the Fofie case, for theFofie case to be used as a measuring rod for the fortunes of the instant suit.” The respondent answers the appellant’s point on the Fofie case as follows (in para.27 of its Statement of Case): “…As regards the argument that the Fofie case is distinguishable from the instant case because there had been previous discussions between the parties in that case, it is our submission that whether or not there had been previous discussions is quite irrelevant to the interpretation of Exhibit A and that what is important is that the language of that letter expresses and conveys an intention to contract.” We find this riposte by the respondent persuasive. Whilst recognising that the decision as to whether any particular set of language and context amounts to an offer or an invitation to treat depends on the detailed facts of specific cases, we also consider that the Fofie case provides a useful pointer regarding how to interpret the alleged offer in this case. In our view, the statement that: “The Board of Directors at the emergency Board meeting held on Friday, 31 December 2004 proposed to sell the Company’s houses being occupied by the Management Staff,” when read together with the two sentences that follow it that: “In this regard, you are being given the first offer to purchase the above-mentioned house at the cost price of US $70,307 or its Cedi equivalent.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"Payment shall be within 6 months.” and the totality of the context within which the transaction took place, can hardly be given any other interpretation than that it was an offer by the defendant/respondent/appellant company. The appellant’s argument that the use of the word “proposed” in the text quoted above robbed the alleged offer of “definitiveness” and therefore rendered it an invitation to treat is weak, because of the existence in that same text of the next two sentences. In those sentences, as will have been noted, the appellant itself characterises its proposal as an “offer”. Although this is not a determinative factor, it is an important indication of what the appellant intended. The first sentence was, in any case, merely introductory to the next two sentences, which contain the substantive offer.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"The use of the expression “proposed to sell” in the introductory sentence does not, therefore, detract from the definiteness of the offer contained in the next two sentences. In any case, the expression “proposed to sell”, in its context, does not necessarily indicate an absence of an intention to make a final proposal capable of being turned into a contract, or, in other words, an offer. We are thus somewhat mystified by the decision of the learned trial judge. We do not agree with him that the letter of 17th January was an invitation to treat. The defendant/respondent/appellant clearly gives to the plaintiff ‘the first offer’ to purchase its house.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"We thus hold that the letter of 17th January constituted an offer, and not an invitation to treat, and that this offer was converted into a contract by the respondent’s acceptance letter of 31st January 2005. From the facts set out above, there was clearly an intention to create legal relations and the respondent’s undertaking to pay the purchase price was consideration enough to result in the formation of a contract. Next, we will quickly and easily dispose of ground (b) of the grounds of appeal.

"As Chitty on Contracts (28th Edition) puts it (in para 28-007): “The law takes the view that the purchaser of a particular piece of land or of a particular house (however ordinary) cannot, on the vendor’s breach, obtain a satisfactory substitute, so that specific performance is available to him.” It is trite law that the equitable remedy of specific performance will be granted, where damages are not an adequate remedy. More recent case-law has tended to state the law in terms of whether it is just in all the circumstances of a particular case for the aggrieved party to be confined to a remedy of damages. However the question is framed, though, there is little doubt that contracts for the sale of land qualify for the remedy, ceteris paribus.

"It will be recalled that these complained that the Court of Appeal’s order to the appellant to refund to the respondent all rents paid by the respondent to the appellant was in error and, further, that the Court of Appeal erred when it retrospectively decreed specific performance of the contract without awarding the plaintiff interest on the purchase price. The appellant contends, in its Statement of Case, that if the respondent had paid the consideration for the contract, which we have found to exist, when it was due, or even at the commencement of the suit, the appellant could have invested that price. The appellant further argues that judicial notice should be taken of the notorious fact that in Ghana property values appreciate. It would thus be unfair for the respondent to pay what is in effect a 2005 price for the property today without the payment of interest to compensate the appellant for the difference in the value of the property between 2005 and currently. The appellant argues that since the price of US $ 70,307 should have been paid in August 2005, “By denying the Appellant interest on the purchase price (and assuming there was a binding contract which is denied), the Respondent had been unjustly enriched thereby.” (Para.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"18 of the Statement of Case.) In reply, the respondent maintains in her Statement of Case that the Court of Appeal was not in error in making the consequential order, after delivering its judgment, that any rents paid by the respondent after November 2005 should be refunded to her, after she had paid the purchase price. She explains that the circumstances that had led to that order were the need to reverse the High Court’s order, made after its judgment, which required the respondent, as part of the terms on which the High Court judgment was stayed, to pay c1,500,000 (GHc150) monthly to the appellant. She argued that since the Court of Appeal had found that she was the equitable owner of the property from January 2005, there was no obligation on her part to pay any rent to the appellant. The reversal of the High Court’s order was thus necessary to reflect the Court of Appeal’s reversal of the High Court’s decision that there was no contract between the parties. We have no difficulty in agreeing with this view and we thus affirm the Court of Appeal’s order that any rents paid to appellant after the High Court’s judgment should be refunded after the order of specific performance has been executed.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"Regarding the distinct issue of the payment of interest on the purchase price, which had been computed with a completion date in 2005 in mind, the counter-argument put up by the respondent is that the appellant failed to provide the respondent with the bank particulars that she had requested to enable her to make payment of the purchase price. Further, she argued that in none of the papers filed before the Court of Appeal was there a claim of interest on the basis of which the Court would have had jurisdiction to award interest in the appellant’s favour. In considering what merit there is in this latter argument against the payment of interest, we consider it helpful to refer to the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Butt v Chapel Hill Properties & Anor \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 636 at p. 652: “Once this Court holds that there was, in effect, an implied loan transaction between the Plaintiff and the first Defendant or the Defendants, the Court is obliged to exercise its statutory power to award interest on the loan implied in order to preserve the value of the capital originally borrowed. Justice requires that on the facts of this case interest be awarded to the Plaintiff, even if not expressly claimed.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"The High Court, under Order 63 rule 6 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 LN140A, has authority to make any order which it considers necessary for doing justice, whether such order has been expressly asked for by the person entitled to the benefit of the order or not. This is an appropriate case for the Supreme Court to exercise this power of the High Court, pursuant to section 2(4) of the Courts Act 1993 under which the Supreme Court has all the powers, authority and jurisdiction vested in any court established by the Constitution or any other law.” Although the Order 63 rule 6 of the repealed High Court Rules referred to in the passage quoted above appears not to have been re-enacted in the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (CI 47), we believe that the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction to make such consequential orders as are necessary for doing justice, even if the beneficiary of such order has not expressly requested it. The Supreme Court would thus vicariously also have this power. In our view, the effect of ordering specific performance of the contract is that the purchaser becomes liable to pay the price at the contractually stipulated due date. On the facts of this case, the price was to be paid within 6 months.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"
"Since the acceptance letter was dated 31st January, the due date was no later than the end of July 2005. Correspondingly, the vendor is obliged to convey its interest to the purchaser with effect from the same date. Prior to conveyance and after the conclusion of the contract, the purchaser is the owner of the property in equity. It follows from the analysis above that the purchaser should be liable to pay interest on the purchase price from the date it was due until the date of judgment in order to preserve the economic value of the purchase price. This Court has power under Rule 1 of the Court (Award of Interest and Post Judgment Interest) Rules 2005 (CI 52) to award interest “on a sum of money due to a party” in an action and we consider that this case is an appropriate one in which to exercise the power in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"

Accordingly, whilst confirming the Court of Appeal’s order of specific performance, we also order, pursuant to Rule 1 of CI 52, that the respondent should pay interest to the appellant on the cedi equivalent of the price of US $ 70,307 from 1st August 2005 till today at the bank rate prevailing today. We do not consider that the neglect of the appellant to furnish the respondent with the particulars of the bank account into which the price should be paid is sufficient reason for the appellant to forfeit its entitlement to interest.

"As Lord Parker has said: “Indeed, the dominant principle has always been that equity will only grant specific performance if, under all the circumstances, it is just and equitable so to do.” (See Stickney v Keeble\[1915\] AC 386 at p. 419). It is our considered view that in the circumstances of this case, it would only be just and equitable for the contract of January 2005 to be specifically enforced if the value of the purchase price under it is preserved through the payment of interest by the respondent to the appellant, along the lines already explained. Accordingly, ground (d) of the appellant’s grounds of appeal is upheld and the respondent is to pay interest on the purchase price to the appellant at the bank rate prevailing today, as already indicated, on the purchase price from 1st August 2005 till today. After judgment, interest will remain payable, by operation of law, till date of final payment, pursuant to Rule 2 of CI 52.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/12/2008', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU FOR THE APPELLANT', 'DOE TSIKATA FOR THE APPELLANT'], 'combinedParties': ['YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['BRIGHT OKYERE-AGYEKU'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['DOE TSIKATA']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA  GHANA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2009-02-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2009, 'month': 'February', 'day': 4}, 'judges': [], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['YAA ANTWI'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['N.T.H.C.']}, 'presidingJudge': 'ADINYIRA, (MRS)', 'source': 'elibrary.jsg.gov.gh', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2009\\YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C..htm', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'YAA ANTWI  VRS  N.T.H.C.', 'short': 'YAA ANTWI vs N.T.H.C.'}}"

"and 2 the additional grounds of appeal do not merit any lengthy consideration; the reason is that there was ample evidence that the respondent retained the documents and sued successfully for the recovery of the debt owed and before the appellant paid the debt in full by instalments. Under cross-examination the appellant said through its representative that the final instalment was made in November 2001 and that very month five of the documents were released to them albeit except the original 89/43. There was no gainsaying that the evidence was clear the respondent retained the documents for the appellant owed in payment of flour supplied to it. The respondent sued for the recovery of the sum owed and the appellant paid the debt by paying in instalments; when the last instalment was paid in November 2001, the respondent released the originals of the documents with the exception of one of them that very month. That meant they were released ‘promptly’ or as soon as the sum owed was paid in full in the last installment.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/22/201120', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['LADY EILEEN ERSKIN FOR THE PLAINTIFF/ APPELANT/ APPELANT', 'CYNTHIA ADWOA OPARE FOR THE DEFENDANT/ RESPONDENT/ RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['GOLDEN GRACE LIMITED  VRS TAKORADI FLOUR MILLS LIMITED'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['LADY EILEEN ERSKIN'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['CYNTHIA ADWOA OPARE']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': 'The plaintiff company was a registered distributor of flour supplied by the defendant company and it surrendered additional documents to the defendant company, pursuant to a supposedmortgage transaction they entered into, so as to secure payment for the increase in the supply of flour to the plaintiff company.

That was how the judgment of the Court of Appeal is to be understood. In conclusion grounds (i) and (iv) of appeal carry no weight and are dismissed. The respondent’s supply of flour to the appellant was terminated in 1998. It was not until November 1999 that the documents were returned to the appellants.

"the respondent owed a duty to pay the respondent for goods supplied him; the respondent was anunpaid seller in terms of the law on the sale of goods.

"A particular lien exists only as a security for the particular debt incurred; while a general lien is available as a security for all debts arising out of similar transaction between the parties…A charging lien is the right to charge property in another’s possession with the payment of a debt or the performance of a duty’’: seeOsborn’s Concise Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition at page 202, (emphasis supplied.) and alsoSnell’s Principles of Equity, Twenty-Seventh Edition, 438. The trial judge relied on the definition of a lien as provided for in Halsbury’s Laws of England 4th Edition Volume 28 paragraph 502at page 221 that: “Lien in its primary or legal sense is a right in one man to retain that which is rightfully and continuously in his possession belonging to another until the present and the accrued claim of the person in possession are satisfied. In this primary sense it is given by law and not by contract.” Thus, on the evidence on record, so long as a debt existed on the earlier transaction between the parties herein, the respondent had the general lien over the documents surrendered to the respondent, till all debts due and owing by the appellant were satisfied. In the result there was ample reason to affirm the Court of Appeal in its holding that the retention of the documents by the respondent was lawful for the respondent exercised a right of lien over them. The appellant made capital of the fact that a document was not returned as the original that it was when it was first deposited; it was a certified true copy that was returned.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'J4/22/201120', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['LADY EILEEN ERSKIN FOR THE PLAINTIFF/ APPELANT/ APPELANT', 'CYNTHIA ADWOA OPARE FOR THE DEFENDANT/ RESPONDENT/ RESPONDENT'], 'combinedParties': ['GOLDEN GRACE LIMITED  VRS TAKORADI FLOUR MILLS LIMITED'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['LADY EILEEN ERSKIN'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['CYNTHIA ADWOA OPARE']}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'SUPREME COURT'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': 'The plaintiff company was a registered distributor of flour supplied by the defendant company and it surrendered additional documents to the defendant company, pursuant to a supposedmortgage transaction they entered into, so as to secure payment for the increase in the supply of flour to the plaintiff company.

"Therefore the respondent failed to return the documents ‘in whole, undefaced or lost.’ The appellant did not mince his words when he submitted there was no evidence the document was lost.

FOR THE APPELLANT', 'MARINA APPIAH OPARE ESQ. (PRINCIPAL STATE ATTORNEY) FOR THE REPUBLIC'], 'combinedParties': ['JOHN BONUAH @ ERIC ANNOR BLAY ... APPELLANT', 'VRS', 'THE REPUBLIC … RESPONDENT', 'WOOD (MRS) CJ', 'On the 28th of February, 2002, the Appellant and one Billy who is at large, were tried and convicted by the Sunyani High Court of the offences of conspiracy to commit robbery to ss. 23 and 149, and robbery contrary to s. 149 of Act 29/60 and sentenced to life imprisonment on each count to run concurrently. Appellant unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”. He however lost the appeal on the jurisdictional ground that', 'appellant committed this offence in 2002. At that time the minimum sentence for robbery with small arms where there was no death was life imprisonment. Even though the law has such been amended with regard to sentencing, we do not have jurisdiction to interfere with the sentence lawfully imposed on the appellant in 2002', 'Dissatisfied, he has with leave, this time around, appealed the conviction on the basis that', '1. “The Court of Appeal made a serious error of law for refusing to look at the appeal against conviction because', 'a. The Record of proceedings from the High Court, Sunyani produced by the Registrar was incomplete due to the non-availability of the other relevant records. The Appellant, reeling under irrevocable sentence of Life imprisonment must not suffer as a result of incompetence of the Record of Proceedings', 'b. There was no evidence to show that he conspired with any other person', 'c. The trial Court failed to order a MINI TRIAL to determine admissibility or otherwise of the alleged confession statement of the Appellant – and this is fatal to the subsequent conviction', 'd. The trial Court failed to investigate the defence of ALIBI that was given right at the onset of his arrest', 'Given the appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to use all legitimate avenues to assert his legal rights, we do not begrudge him for challenging the conviction, with the object of having it stripped of legitimacy, root and branch. What we find objectionable is the charge of dereliction of duty leveled against the appellate justices who heard his appeal, when on his own clear choosing, the appeal ground and indeed the arguments marshalled in support hereof were all targeted at only the sentence. Indeed, at the hearing, the appellant did not, in the slightest sense of the word, impugn the validity of the conviction. Contrarily, the appeal grounds and the supporting arguments thereof, coupled with the record of appeal the court was seized with, relevantly, the summing up and the very brief court sentencing orders, negates the charge of willful neglect', 'Following the dismissal of his appeal, the appellant first applied to this honourable court for extension of time to appeal the decision. The motion which was heard by a single justice of this court was however denied. Undaunted, he repeated the leave application before a three judge bench, pursuant to article 134 (a) of the 1992 Constitution. The three judge panel, while in agreement with the Court of Appeal on the legality of thesentence of life imprisonment, nevertheless, on the strength of his proposed appeal against conviction, granted the motion. The court reasoned that although', 'it is true that the sentence cannot be disturbed…whether or not it was right in imposing the sentence depends on whether or not the conviction itself was justifiable', 'In other words, this court decided in the paramount interest of justice that the appellant be given the opportunity to challenge, albeit, for the first time on appeal, the validity of the conviction which forms the sub-stratum of the sentence earlier complained of', 'At the first hearing of the appeal, it became clearly evident, to our utter chagrin that a substantial segment of the criminal trial record made up of the entire testimonial evidence of the nine prosecution witnesses, as well as the appellant’s, could not be traced. How thecoretrial records could disappear from the registry, leaving us with only the non-essential segment; the shell, so to speak, remains a mystery. This has ultimately led us to explore the frontiers of our criminal jurisprudence on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings, with a view to establishing the legal principles governing this area of the law, and placing same on a sound footing', 'Generally, the responsibility for keeping court records in safe and proper custody and producing them on demand rests on the Registrar of the relevant court. The guaranteed constitutional right to a fair trial within a reasonable time under article 19 (1) of the 1992 Constitution ought to be generously and purposively construed to include a fair appeal hearing within a reasonable time. This right, on demand and subject to the fulfillment of all necessary legal and administrative requirements, includes an untrammelled access to the full record of the trial proceedings. Westate this as the standard rule, as clearly, this right may be lost or curtailed through an appellant’s own criminal actions, the clearest example being where an appellant conspires with others to have all his trial records destroyed. But, an appellant’s inability, through no fault of his, to fully access the trial records, for purposes of obtaining a merit-based determination of his appeal, is a clear violation of his constitutional right to fair hearing. In this instant case, the only available judicial records were the statement of offence, the facts of the case, the bill of indictment, the appellant’s cautioned statements, the summing up and the sentencing andconsequential orders of the trial court. Counsel’s brief of legal arguments emphasized the gross injustice appellant stood to suffer, on account of this incomplete record. It was to correct this anomaly, promote justice and prevent a travesty that, at the first hearing, we made the following crucial orders', '1. “…The Registrar of the Sunyani High Court produces certified true copies of all full records of proceedings in this criminal matter within one (1) month of today, with copies having been served on all the parties and this Court by the said date', '2. Failing which we order the Registrar of the Court to file an affidavit making full disclosure on the whereabouts of the record, by this said date, i.e. a month from the date of these orders', 'The verified terse affidavit of Kofi Jacob Kumah, the Registrar, reads', '1. “That on 13th January, 2015 that Honourable Court at its sitting ordered me to produce Certified True Copies of the record of proceedings in the above criminal case that was decided in that court', '2. That in spite of diligent search conducted in this registry, I could not trace the record of proceeding or any part thereof', '3. Wherefore I make this oath in compliance with the Honourable Court’s order dated 13th January, 2015', 'Without subjecting the paragraph 2 of the affidavit in particular to any further thorough enquiry, we proceeded to determine the matter based on the limited record at our disposal. Admittedly, our failure to fully interrogate the circumstances leading to the loss of the records and the alleged genuinely diligent search for its retrieval might appear to have fallen short of jurisprudential best practice, but we justified this approach in the context of this case', 'In the final analysis, the legal question we identified as being pertinent for our consideration is this. In a criminal appeal against conviction or sentence, what judicial outcomes are open to an appellate court seized with an incomplete trial proceedings or records, on account of all or a significant segment of the trial records being lost or completely destroyed? Stated differently, what reliefs is an appellant entitled to? Does it exclude or include a setting aside of the decision, that is, an acquittal, on the basis that the general rule that an impugned decision is prima facie correct until otherwise declared, cannot be made to apply under those clearly defined circumstances where the records, through no fault of the appellant, are irretrievably lost or destroyed', 'Judicial records are clearly vital to the proper functioning of courts. But these may be lost or destroyed either through plain burglary, or fire or some other unfortunate natural calamity. In this technological age, it may also be lost through the inability to recover electronic data; that is recorded court proceedings, or scanned exhibits, from a crashed computer. Thus, it is not only against sound judicial policy, but clearly impracticable to prescribe a one- size- fit all uniform conduct in matters of lost or destroyed judicial records, given the varying circumstances of each case and also the several related factors that must legitimately influence judicial decisions arising from such incidents', 'Thus, in cases of this kind, the real challenge lies in reconciling two competing interests. These are firstly, an appellant’s unfettered constitutional right to a fair hearing, as already noted, a fair and just appeal hearing on the merits within a reasonable time, by direct access to the trial record, in conformity with the fundamental principle that an appeal is a re-hearing; and secondly, the overriding constitutional duty of appellate courts, indeed all courts, to keep the streams of justice pure; to protect it from manipulation and abuse, and from being overran by unscrupulous persons acting in collusion with dishonourable court officials to pervert its course. Inevitably, an appellate court faced with this impasse has a duty to ensure, on balance, that these competing interests are simultaneously realised', 'The unavailability of judicial precedent in this unchartered area of our law made it imperative that were sort to foreign case- law to guide our formulation of the relevant legal principles. In this regard, we commend Respondent Counsel for her industry and invaluable assistance to this court, when compelled by the novelty of this cause; we called for fresh legal arguments on the core issues raised', 'It emerges from the jurisprudence of foreign courts that in some jurisdictions, the law on lost or destroyed judicial proceedings is codified, while in others the legal principles have developed from case-law. But, invariably, these principles conform largely to those that obtain in the statutorily controlled regimes. We recommend that the Honourable Attorney –General and the Rules of Court Committee examine the viability of providing the necessary legislative framework to govern the adjudication of such cases in our jurisdiction. Any such legislative intervention, we propose, must endeavour to achieve two broad objectives. The embodying rules must ensure clarity and certainty, but, should not be so restrictive as to limit the court’s ability to adapt the law to varying circumstances, thereby hampering judicial development', 'We have chosen two examples of codified principles, from across the global economic divide-The United States and The Philippines-for our learning', 'The first is the “U.S. Code: Title 28-Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Part V Chapter 115 - Evidence; Documentary 1734 – Court record lost or destroyed” provides', 'a. “A lost or destroyed record of any proceeding in any court of the United States may be supplied on application of any interested party not at fault, by substituting a copy certified by the clerk of any court in which an authentic copy is lodged', 'b. Where a certified copy is not available, any interested person not at fault may file in such court a verified application for an order establishing the lost or destroyed record', '28 U. S. Code & 1735 – Court record lost or destroyed where United States interested, provides that', 'a. When the record of any case or matter in any court of the United States to which the United States is a party, is lost or destroyed, a certified copy of any official paper of a United States attorney, United States marshal or clerk or other certifying or recording officer of any such court, made pursuant to law, on file in any department or agency of the United States and relating to such case or matter, shall, on being filed in the court to which it relates, have the same effect as an original paper filed in such court', 'b. Whenever the United States is interested in any lost or destroyed records or files of a court of the United States, the clerk of such court and the United States attorney for the district shall take the steps necessary to restore such records or files, under the direction of the judges of such court', 'States within the US, such as Wisconsin, Texas, Illinois (Court Records Restoration Act of Illinois (705 ILCS 85) section 1) have similar regulations', 'Thus, Rule 34.6(f) of Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides', 'Reporter’s Record Lost or Destroyed. An appellant is entitled to a new trial under the following circumstances', '1) If the appellant has timely requested a reporter’s record', '2) If, without the appellant’s fault, a significant exhibit or a significant portion of the court reporter’s notes and records has been lost or destroyed or – if the proceedings were electronically recorded – a significant portion of the recoding has been lost or destroyed or is inaudible', '3) If the lost, destroyed, or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record or the lost or destroyed exhibit, is necessary to the appeal’s resolution; and', '4) If the lost, destroyed or inaudible portion of the reporter’s record cannot be replaced by agreement of the parties, or the lost or destroyed exhibit cannot be replaced either by agreement of the parties with a copy determined by the trial court to accurately duplicate with reasonable certainty the original exhibit', 'The criminal case of the State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR, decided August 2, 2005, on the basis of the relevant legislation, set out the relevant factors that must inform the court’s decisions. Understandably, it emphasises the necessity for the court to ensure that a reconstructed record adequately reflects what actually occurred at the hearing', 'Act No. 3110 of The Philippines, an Act To Provide an Adequate Procedure For The Reconstitution Of The Records Of Pending Judicial Proceedings And Books, Documents, And Files Of The Register Of Deeds, Destroyed By Fire Or Other Public Calamities, And For Other Purposes stipulates in part', 'Pending Criminal Actions', 'Sec. 13. Pending criminal actions shall be reconstituted by means of fiscal and the counsel for the defendant or the defendant himself, or certified by them under oath as being correct, and whatever cannot be reconstituted in this manner shall be reconstructed by, means of the supplementary procedure, provided for the reconstitution of ordinary civil cases', 'Sec. 14. The testimony of witnesses, if any has already been taken, shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy thereof or by a new transcript of the stenographic notes; but if it is impossible to obtain an authentic copy of the evidence and if the stenographic notes have been destroyed, the case shall be heard anew as if it had never been tried', 'Sec. 15. If the case has already been decided, the decision shall be reconstituted by means of an authentic copy. If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided', 'The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities', 'Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A401/2011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that', 'An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the appellant have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (105/2007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the responsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the appellant responsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the appellant, has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the appellant could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An appellant is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, responsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an appellant who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the appellant’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff Respondent v. Joseph P Defilipino, Defendant- Appellant, No 2005 AP515 –CR) (supra) the authenticity of the reconstructed segment', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the appellant in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an appellant is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If appellant is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent appellant. But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the appellant in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the appellant was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['NKRABEAH EFFAH DARTEY ESQ', 'MARINA APPIAH OPARE ESQ.

The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record', 'Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus', 'Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E', 'The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus', 'the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b', 'The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows', 'a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record', 'b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues', 'In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms', 'In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered', 'Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that', 'the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law', 'The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial', 'The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact', 'Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors', 'First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes', 'The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings', 'The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision', 'Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials', 'Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino', 'Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any', 'We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings', 'An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question', 'Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record', 'If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses', 'In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc', 'In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records', 'In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following', 'Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced', 'Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility']}, 'presidingJudge': 'Wood, CJ', 'source': 'ghalii.org', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\Supreme court\\2015\\122.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'JOHN BONUAH @ ERIC ANNOR BLAY vs THE REPUBLIC & WOOD (MRS) CJ & On the 28th of February, 2002, the  and one Billy who is at large, were tried and convicted by the Sunyani High Court of the offences of conspiracy to commit robbery to ss. 23 and 149, and robbery contrary to s. 149 of Act 2960 and sentenced to life imprisonment on each count to run concurrently.  unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence, on grounds of its harshness and excessiveness, as he contended, “given the circumstances of the case”.

If an authentic copy is not obtainable, the case shall be decided anew, as if it had never been decided & The jurisprudence of countries without specific statutory rules on lost or destroyed judicial records such as South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, provided us with the necessary persuasive authorities & Weexamine the South African legal position from three cases. First, the case of S v Siibelelwana (A4012011) [2012] ZAWCHC150 (3 August 2012), in which it was held that & An accused is not ipso facto entitled to his discharge if the record or portions thereof get lost. The best possible evidence of the record should rather be obtained and information on what was testified or said during the trial should be sought from every source that can make a contribution. When the record of the proceedings in the court a quo is inadequate for a proper consideration of the appeal, both the state and the  have a duty to try and reconstruct the record & Second, is the criminal case of S v Van Standen (1052007)[2008] (2)SCAR, 626. This case dealt inter alia, with an application for leave to appeal against sentence, in circumstances where the missing record of the trial proceedings could not be reconstructed. The court expounded the law thus & Where an accused has the right to appeal and a missing or incomplete record makes it impossible to consider and adjudicate such appeal, the conviction or sentence will often be set aside… The mere fact that the record of proceedings might be lost or incomplete would not, however, automatically entitle an accused to the setting aside of a conviction or sentence. Such relief will only be granted where a valid and enforceable right of appeal is frustrated by the fact that the record is lost or destroyed and cannot be reconstructed (see SVK, supra, at 192i-194b, S v Ntantiso and Others 1997 (2) SACR 302 (E) and S v Leslie 2000(1) SACR 347 (W) at 353 D-E & The court explained the philosophy underlying the grant of this relief thus & the State is burdened with the onsibility of keeping proper record of trial proceedings and that an accused’s right to a fair trial (and therefore also to the right of appeal) should not be frustrated by the State’s failure to do so (see S Zondi, supra, at 243i-244b and S v S195 (2) SACR420 (T) at 42b & The more recent South African case of The State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, decided by the North Gauteng High Court on 28th March 2014, a case in which the court records were destroyed by a tragic fire that ravaged the court buildings, outlines the influencing factors of the step by step approach to the proper judicial decision. The principles may be summarised as follows & a. The court has a duty to “try its level best to reconstruct the record & b. The parties must agree to the correctness or accuracy of the reconstructed record & c. The case is to be tried de novo, if the parties are not in agreement on the correctness of the record and the areas of disagreement are substantial and relevant to a resolution of the identified issues & In the Kenyan case of Benjamin Onganya & Another v Republic [2013] eKLR, where the appeal could not be heard because the court records had been officially destroyed, the court again approved the standard principles governing lost records in these terms & In such as a situation as this, the Court must try to hold the scales of justice and in doing so must consider all the circumstances under which the loss has occurred. Who occasioned the loss of all the files? Is the  onsible? Should he benefit from his own mischief and illegality? In the final analysis, the paramount consideration must be whether the order proposed to be made is the one which serves the best interest of justice. An acquittal should not follow as a matter of course where a file has disappeared. After all a person, like the , has lost the benefit of the presumption of innocence given to him by Section 77(2) (a) of the Constitution he having been convicted by a competent court and on appeal the burden is on him to show that the court which convicted him did so in error. Thus, the loss of the files and proceedings may deprive him of ability to discharge that burden, but, it by no means follows that he must of necessity be treated as innocent and automatically acquitted. The interest of justice as a whole be considered & Another Kenyan case; Joseph Maina Kariuki v Republic; Criminal Appeals Nos. 53&105 of 2004 EklRoffers persuasive guidance on the relevant factors that influence judicial outcomes. In that case, the appellate court in examining the alternative of a trial de novo observed on the peculiar facts that & the  could not be kept in prison indefinitely when it was possible for his appeal to have been concluded according to the law & The clearly distinct jurisprudence which emerges from a comparative analysis of the governing principles in both the statutory and non-statutory jurisdictions alike is this. An  is not automatically entitled to an acquittal upon the mere proof of lost or destroyed trial proceedings. The quantum or magnitude of the missing record- lost or destroyed- and its centrality to the resolution of the appeal is the first criterion that merits attention. Thus, it is not every missing part of a trial record that would prejudice a merit- based determination of an appeal, but only that which is vital to its fair, just and conclusive determination. We cite this example for purposes of clarity. In an appeal against sentence, where from the available records, the clear intention is for a plea for mercy and compassion, or in the case of an appeal based exclusively on a pure question of law, without recourse to the proven facts of the case, the absence of the full record of the trial may not be fatal to its fair and just determination. Inarguably, an appeal against conviction is more likely to pose greater difficulty than one against sentence, and which is not predicated on any of the proven facts of the case that is, evidence led at the trial & The cardinal principle is that the law does not demand a hundred percent perfect record of proceedings, but such adequate record that can answer to the issues raised on appeal. Adequacy of the record test is therefore a question determinable on the facts, by reference to the grounds of appeal; weighed against the available record or alternatively the lost or destroyed record. The Texas criminal appeal case of James Robert Vasquez v The State of Texas the tenth Court of Appeals in its opinion delivered on 21st September, 2011 underscores the importance of a clear and conclusive resolution of this essential fact & Where it is proven that the missing record is material to the determination of the appeal, the next important task is for the court to determine the viability of a reconstruction of the lost record. This could be on application of either party or by the court acting on its own motion. But since the whole theory of reconstruction is to reproduce the lost or destroyed proceedings; it is subject to other factors & First, it must be evident that the applicant is not at fault, that is, onsible or blamable for the loss or destruction. It is thus absolutely inconceivable for an  who causes the loss or destruction of official court proceedings, to be permitted to profit by his crime. To the contrary, not only would this fact weigh against reconstruction let alone a setting aside of the conviction or sentence, but additionally, the State ought to exact the severest sanction permitted under the law for such crimes & The sound policy reasoning that persons who escape from lawful custody, on being captured, deserves to be tried and punished for the offence of escaping from lawful custody, is that which justifies this argument to serve as a deterrent to others. We think such obvious cases justifiably call for a striking off the appeal on the basis that it cannot be disposed of without the proceedings & The second factor is whether or not the ’s request for the record was timely; making reconstruction a feasible option. If not, depending on the nature of the offence and availability of witnesses, a re-trial might be the more appropriate decision & Third, the availability of the best contemporaneous and most reliable material from credible sourcesis a key factor. In the South African case of the State v Nare Benjamin Chokoe, (supra), a decision of the North Gauteng High Court, dated the 28th March 2014, however, the court observed that the State prosecutor and the Defence Attorney could reconstruct from their notes taken at the trial. Clearly, given such critical factors as memory loss, reconstruction based simply on the recollection of parties, counsel, court officers or even judges, without any corroborative documents or notes, ought not to be encouraged. Also, the viability of the reconstruction option rests inter alia on the length and the straight forwardness of the trial and proceedings. Thus, notes taken at uncomplicated guilty plea hearings are more likely to be authentic than those purportedly recorded during a lengthy and complex trials & Fourth, whatever materials are used to reconstruct, the parties are entitled as of right to scrutinise the reconstituted record and agree on its accuracy or correctness. In the final analysis, the onsibility rests on the court to ensure with reasonable certainty (Texas Rules Of Appellate Procedure) or beyond reasonable doubt ((State of Wisconsin, Plaintiff  v. Joseph P Defilipino & Where reconstruction is neither feasible nor possible, the court should consider a re-trial. Again, this is dependent on other criteria, with sound prudential and legal reasons being central to the court’s final decision. The critical known factors include the availability of witnesses, the nature, seriousness or complexity of the offence, and time spent by the  in custody, if any & We would adopt the enlightened approaches that consistently run through the decisions of the jurisdictions we have referred to and state the following as the general rule. The first fundamental principle is that an  is not entitled to an acquittal on the mere basis of the loss or destruction of the judicial records, notably, trial proceedings & An allegation that court proceedings are lost or destroyed require investigations into three important areas, the veracity of the claim, the quantum or magnitude of the lost, missing or destroyed record and its relevance to the determination of the appeal in question & Next, what or who caused the loss or destruction? Who stands to benefit? Depending on the finding, a reconstruction may be ordered from a variety of sources depending on the availability of contemporaneous and reliable material from which to reconstruct, with the parties, their counsel and finally the court being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the reconstructed record & If  is not blamable for the loss or destruction, or if reconstruction is impossible, then a retrial may, depending on the circumstances, be ordered and genuine efforts made to trace the witnesses & In the event of the prosecution’s clear inability to secure witnesses, the ultimate order of conditional or unconditional discharge must inure to the benefit of an innocent . But this extreme order must be made sparingly. It must apply in those exceptional cases, where the evidence points beyond reasonable doubt to the innocence of the  in relation to the missing records, the nature of the offence the  was charged with and the length of time spent in custody, etc & In all this, accountability principles ought to be rigorously enforced, for all persons, officers, etc. found culpable for the loss or destruction appropriately being sanctioned, in order to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system and save itfrom total collapse. But, we would at the same time, strongly advocate the adoption of safe and secure recording and archival systems for court records & In this instant case, we are minded, as a first step, to opt for his conditional discharge, rather than his re-trial on account of the following & Firstly, we have no evidence that he is blamable for the loss, which loss, from the antecedents of this case, we discover, was in existence at the Court of Appeal stage. Certainly, we thought, if he colluded with others while in custody to have the records destroyed, would he not have taken steps to benefit from this almost immediately? Why would he continue to languish in prison for another couple of years before proceeding to the Supreme Court for relief? But we also recognise that he was dilatory and did not act timeously to apply for the record of appeal. He did so ten years into his conviction, by which date the records could not be traced & Secondly, it is extremely doubtful that the trial judge, the jury, as well as the prosecution and the defence kept reliable written notes of the evidence tendered in court or has recorded material which we can use to reconstruct the lost evidence of the nine witnesses who testified at the jury trial over a decade ago. We also doubt if the contemporaneity test can even be satisfied. Thus, the quantum of lost evidence and the other critical factors make reconstruction a clear impossibility', 'short': 'Bonuah vs Republic'}}"

From the above testimony, the impression is created that they were taken after the alleged stabbing but a closer look of the photographs show that there is no indicia of the injury such as blood from the injury and/or any other sign of it.

According to the Plaintiff the writ of summons was amended and filed on 6th July, 2012 after discovering the Defendant as owners of the vehicle which damaged his vehicle.

"The Plaintiff further pleaded that after many years of delay the Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff a letter on a “without prejudice” basis through their lawyer “seeking settlement out of court dated 3/2/2017; suffice to say the attempt at settlement failed”. The Plaintiff’s further pleading was that “at all material times the long delays were occasioned by the Defendant who instructed his solicitor to serve on Plaintiff a letter proposing settlement; and this dragged the case further, requiring filing for default judgement to no avail” (8) The Plaintiff again pleaded that the Defendant having “voluntarily admitted ownership of the vehicle under their own signature, on or about 7/2/2012; and same fact earlier stated by a Police Accident Report dated 21/02/2011, the Defendant nevertheless found different ploys to drag out the case, including filing of motions 13/01/2012 that it should be misjoined; and other technicalities that should not be entertained”. (9) The Plaintiff further pleaded that “Plaintiff realized his great loss if he remained stuck to the estimates or reliefs of the suit in 2011; and sought leave to amend his Witness Statement earlier filed. This was granted and Plaintiff filed a fresh Witness Statement on 14-12-2016 and sought, by the exigencies of the situation, the demand for a replacement vehicle worth in December 2016 GH¢60,000.00 by reason that the original relief for repair was inoperable because the Plaintiff’s vehicle was no longer repairable, having rotten down sitting in one place for 6 years.

By the Statement of Defence filed on February 3, 2016, the Defendant denies paragraph 3 to 11 of the Plaintiff’s Amended Statement of Claim and pleaded that the Plaintiff shall be put to strict proof of those averments. The Defendant pleaded at paragraph 5 of the Statement of Defence that at all material times the Defendant did not exercise any control over the driver.

"Determination of the Issues by the Court (14) The issues set down for determination above notwithstanding, after hearing the evidence, the issues that have become pertinent are the identity and capacity of the Plaintiff to institute the action and the two additional issues above. In my view the determination of those issues will no doubt effectively determine the dispute between the parties. This is because based on the evidence heard I note that the Defendant did not contest the circumstances of the accident and the damage to the Plaintiff’s vehicle, as well as the allegations of negligence of the driver Akosa Kwadwo because it took the position that the driver was not its employee or agent and therefore not liable for his alleged negligence. (15) The law is trite that a party who asserts a fact assumes the responsibility of proving same. The burden of producing evidence as well as the burden of persuasion is therefore cast on that party and the standard required is provided for by virtue of sections 10,11 and 12 of the Evidence Act 1975 \[NRCD 323).","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

The burden only shifts to the defence to lead sufficient evidence to tip the scales in his favour when on a particular issue, the Plaintiff leads some evidence to prove his claim.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

PERGAH TRANSPORT LTD & ORS \[2010\] SCGLR 728 where in unanimously dismissing an appeal, the Supreme Court held inter alia as follows: “It is a basic principle of the law on evidence that a party who bears the burden of proof is to produce the required evidence of the facts in issue that has the quality of credibility short of which his claim may fail. The method of producing evidence is varied and it includes the testimonies of the party and material witnesses, admissible hearsay, documentary and things (often described as real evidence), without which the party might not succeed to establish the requisite degree of credibility concerning a fact in the mind of the court or tribunal of fact such as a jury. It is trite law that matters that are capable of proof must be proved by producing evidence so that on all the evidence a reasonable mind could conclude that the existence of the fact is more reasonable than its non-existence. This is a requirement of the law on evidence under sections 10(1) and (2) and 11(1) and (4) of the Evidence Act, 1975 (NRCD 323).” The Plaintiff’s Evidence: (18) The Plaintiff’s case consisted of his testimony in court and the documentary evidence he submitted in support of his claim, marked in the record as Exhibits “A” to “D”.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"My Lord I can, because even driving license when we suspect it is fake, we write to the DVLA”. (31) Further to the above exchange, Counsel in his written legal submission to the Court stated that “The Plaintiff’s identity and capacity have been called into question because the Plaintiff himself has tendered vehicle registration certificates (Exhibits C and D) before the Honourable Court bearing two different names i.e. Adjei Yakubu and Adjuik Yakubu, each purporting to emanate from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA). These are the documents which were tendered to attempt to prove Plaintiff’s capacity as owner of the vehicle against whom an alleged tort has been committed.

"(32) Counsel continued after analysing the evidence of Police Officer Tetteh that “It is our humble opinion that the proper persons to testify to this inconsistency would be the DVLA as both Exhibits C and D emanate from DVLA and are known to be in the custody of DVLA. CW1 offered no explanation as to the inconsistency. Plaintiff and his Counsel also offered nothing by way of evidence to prove the identity and capacity of the Plaintiff as owner of the vehicle involved in the alleged tort. It is our opinion that having alleged to be the bona fide owner of the vehicle, the burden of proof was on Plaintiff to prove his identity and capacity as owner of the vehicle involved in the alleged tort”.

"Without doubt the settled rule of law is that the capacity of a party to mount an action may be challenged at any time, and even on appeal. The case, YORKWA v DUAH (1992-93) GBR 278 C/A illustrates the principle that where a person’s capacity to initiate an action was in issue it is no answer to give him a hearing on its merits even if he had a cast-iron case. See also the Supreme Court case of FOSUA & ADU-POKU v. DUFIE (Deceased) & ADU-POKU MENSAH \[2009\] SCGLR 310 where His Lordship Dotse JSC opined that “Want of capacity is a point of law which, if raised, goes to the root of the action”.

"From the facts the Defendant cannot point to any known and existing person called “Adjei Yakubu” who is connected to the case at bar except the Plaintiff herein. While indeed, an officer from the DVLA’s appearance in Court to speak to the issue may have been the best option, in my opinion their non-appearance is also not fatal based on the facts. I accept as proper the testimony of Inspector Bernard Ayertey Tetteh on the issue. I also accept as a fact that the actions taken by him as part of his official duty are supportable in law as same is covered under Section 37 of the Evidence Act. Based on the law therefore, I am satisfied that the discrepancy in the name of the Plaintiff as appears on Exhibits “C” and “D” was explained away by CW1 as a clear case of a typographical error and I therefore hold that the Plaintiff’s capacity has been established based on the evidence and the law.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"(36) Black’s Law dictionary defines vicarious liability as liability that a supervisory party (such an employer) bears for the actionable conduct of a subordinate or associate (such as an employee) based on the relationship between the two parties. This liability is based on the principle of “respondeat superior.” Thus employers are vicariously liable for the negligent acts or omissions by their employees in the course of their employment. The principle was duly explained by Lord Nicholls in the case of Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam (2002) 3 WLR 1913. He opined that, “The underlying legal policy is based on the recognition that carrying on a business enterprise necessarily involves risk to others. It involves the risk that others will be harmed by wrongful acts committed by the agents through whom the business is carried on.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"When those risks ripen into loss, it is just that the business should be responsible for compensating the person who has been wronged.” In establishing vicarious liability, three primary requirements must be met. There must be a relationship of control; a tortious act and the act must be done in the course of employment. (37) The law is that for an employer to be vicariously liable, there must be a requisite relationship between the employer and the tortfeasor. Thus the tortfeasor must be an employee of the employer. See .Bramwell LJ in the case of YEWEN v NOAKES (1880) 6 QBD 530 and his elucidation of the law as to who an employee is.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"(42) Mr. Nti in his submission cited the case of KOBINA AND ANOTHER v. BADU \[1968\] GLR 1150-1156, a decision of Aboagye J, sitting at the High Court, Sekondi to state that where a Plaintiff in an action for negligence proved that damage had been caused by the Defendant’s motor car the fact of ownership of the motor car was, prima facie evidence that the motor car at the material time, was driven by the owner or his agent or servant in the course of his employment”. Counsel also cited other cases to say that the Defendant is vicariously liable. (43) Having critically reviewed all of the evidence I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s action fails based on the following reasons stated below.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"First and foremost, I am of the respectful view that Counsel for the Plaintiff has misconceived the law as articulated by Aboagye J. Respectfully, I do not agree with Counsel because unlike the Kobina v Badu case above, the factual situation here does not include an admission of liability by the driver Akosah Kwadwo or a finding of this Court that he is liable for the accident due to his carelessness and/or negligence. With respect, the Plaintiff has erroneously relied on the conviction of the driver at the District Court to say the Defendant is liable. That has never been the law and the practice. The practice has always been that the driver ought to be a party to such a suit.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"He initially said he had no proof that he was an employee of the Defendant but later said he was the Defendant’s agent. Also, there is no evidence that even if Akosah Kwadwo was the agent Defendant he had the express authority of the Defendant for the plea of guilt at the District Court. (45) The law as I understand it is that in a matter such as one at bar, first and foremost there must be evidence to show that the driver was the employee of the owner and he was operating the vehicle in the course of his employment. Also, my read and review of all the cases cited by Counsel and my own research educates me that in cases such as the one at bar, there must be an establishment of liability against the driver before same can be attributed to the owner.

"With all due deference to the Plaintiff and Counsel, without a finding of careless driving and negligence of the driver there cannot be a finding of vicarious liability of the owner based on the law. (46) In this case I am of the opinion that the Defendant rebutted the presumption that Akosah Kwadwo was not its agent or employee based on the positive unimpeached evidence of the Defendant’s witness. It was therefore the Plaintiff’s onus to show that Akosah Kwadwo was indeed the agent of the Defendant. I am of the respectful view that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that there is a requisite relationship between Akosah Kwadwo, the driver of the Kia Rhino Truck and the Defendant. Therefore the Defendant cannot be said to be vicariously liable for the act of the driver who was not its employee.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"To my mind, mere ownership of the vehicle is not enough evidence to prove the Defendant’s liability in law of the alleged careless driving and negligence of the driver. Conclusion & Disposition: (47) From the above discourse therefore, I hold that the Defendant is not vicariously liable for the acts of Akosa Kwadwo the driver as the only evidence before the Court and which I accept is that he was not an employee or agent of the Defendant. Also, there is no evidence that the Defendant exercised control and possession of the KIA Rhino vehicle. As I have extensively discussed above, it was important for the Plaintiff to maintain the action against the driver, Akosah Kwadwo, Samuel Adjei who contracted the loan to purchase the vehicle, the Insurance Company and then the Defendant herein. The evidence before me amply shows that the Defendant cannot be held vicariously liable for the acts of the driver, Akosah Kwadwo just because its name appears on the DVLA documents as the owner.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"To my mind the Defendant successfully explained the circumstances of its ownership and I accept same as reasonable. Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s case is DISMISSED. Finally, I consider it necessary to say that I have not come to this conclusion with any relish because of the peculiar facts of this case undoubtedly makes me have some sympathy for the Plaintiff. However whilst sympathizing with the Plaintiff for his plight because he has lost his source of income I can only re-echo the wise words of the late Chief Justice of this Republic, Justice Wiredu when he stated in OWUSU V. ASANTE (1992-93) 2GBR 462 @ 495, Wiredu that “Judicial sympathy, however plausible cannot be elevated into a principle of law.” Taking a cue, in my respectful opinion, no matter how strong a sympathy I may feel for the Plaintiff based on the circumstances of the case, that on its own cannot trump and override the fact that the law ought to be applied.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'BC/418/2011', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

The Company may apply to the court for relief against the disability imposed by subsection (3) and the court, on being satisfied that it is just and equitable to grant relief, may grant the relief generally or as respects a particular contract and on the conditions that the court may impose” The second ground stood on by Respondent to the life of this action is that counsel for Applicant Mr. E.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"N. Poku of Poku Nyamaa and Associates was not properly authorized by the Company to represent its interest in this law suit, and should therefore not be allowed to represent the Applicant. The high court agreed with Respondent on their arguments, and held that, even though the court had not been told how many directors the Company had, the writ was null and void on the ground that on an interpretation of Section 189 (3) and 4 (a) of Act 179, the Applicant should have come to court and demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that they have a just cause to seek redress against the 1st Defendant, and not go to court as of right. The court also held that after examining a Power of Attorney held by Applicant counsel, he was satisfied that the power of attorney only authorized Applicant counsel to represent the managing director of the Applicant Company in relation to the sale of the Company and therefore it ‘never authorized learned counsel to represent the (Applicant) in this suit.’ He therefore restrained Applicant counsel from representing the Applicant and struck out the writ, without allowing a consideration of the merits of the Applicant’s complaints. Appellant appealed against this judgment on the following grounds: Grounds of appeal The learned trial judge did not properly construe section 189 of the Companies Act 1963, Act 179 in the context of the whole statute that is Act 179.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

That granted arguendo that any monies were paid by the 1st Defendant, from the said MOU, they were not paid to the Plaintiff but to the 2nd Defendant herein and the present lawyers of 1st Defendant on record for which reason it would not be just and convenient for Plaintiff to retrieve monies which are already with the Defendants and/or with the 1st Defendant’s lawyer Mariam Agyeman Gyasi Jawhary…’ He also urged in paragraph 30 of the affidavit that the Applicant had already tried to retrieve this 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis and it was unable to fulfill the condition of retrieving the money because the 1st Respondent failed to assist the Applicant to retrieve the said monies which the 1st Respondent had purportedly paid its own lawyers and the Amakomhene and this is why the order for injunction lapsed.

In this report, (exhibit L) the 3rd Respondent stated that the lease expired in 2011 and the land was being repossessed by the 2nd Respondent. This ‘re-possession’ position was different from the alleged ‘renewal’ earlier complained of by the Applicant in its Statement of Claim as forming the basis of the alleged Memorandum of Understanding reached between the 1st Respondent and the shareholders of the Applicant which the Applicant had brought to court for the reliefs claimed.

"Francis Nyama Oppon. According to Applicant, what was significant about this indenture is that the 2nd Respondent, who according to 3rd Respondent was ready to re-possess the ‘expired’ lease, had consented to the assignment of the 99 years lease to the Applicant, showing that the 3rd Respondent had at all times known that the lease was to expire in 2060 and not 2011. In effect, the basis for the transaction which the Applicant had already brought to court for cancellation on grounds of contract failure through misrepresentation, and invalidity of corporate authority, was also affected negatively by wrong transactions being conducted around the land by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, and on the blind side of the Applicant. He argued that these new documentation presented a change in the dynamics of the present case, necessitating the court to consider the justice and convenience of the case and repeat its order for injunction without the condition attached.

"Once again, its response hinge on procedural and technical reasons for not listening to the application. First they argue that the writ was struck out and therefore there is no action pending in the courts to allow this court to consider the application for injunction. Second, they point to the string of applications that the Applicant has brought to court in the quest for an injunction and prays the court to find this application an abuse of process. Third, they point to the decision in the case of Republic v High Court, Accra (Commercial Division); Ex Parte Hesse, (Investcom Consortium Holdings SA & Scancom Ltd Interested Parties) 2007-2008 SC GLR 1230. In holding 4, the Supreme Court had said that “notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal against an order of refusal of an application, or the fact that an appellate court was seised with the appeal, and consequently all applications related thereto must be presented to the appellate court, not the court of first instance; where a losing party has come by new or fresh material in circumstances that justify a repeat application, it – the repeat application – must be laid before the trial court, not the appellate court, since it would be a fresh application, wholly independent of the first” It was their submission that if this application for injunction is a repeat application premised on the discoveries in the 3rd Respondent’s letter of 25th April 2016 about the 2nd Respondent repossessing the land in issue, rather than the 2nd and 3rd Respondent renewing the lease; as well as the sighting of 3rd Respondent’s consent to the original lessor assigning his interest in a 99 year lease to the Applicant; then per the above holding, the proper forum for this fresh application is the high court.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"Their fourth argument is that since the record of appeal has not as yet been transmitted to the Court of Appeal by the issue of Form 6, the court of appeal is not seised with jurisdiction to hear an application such as an application for injunction.

Their submission is that until the transmission of the record of appeal, the only applications the court of appeal can determine as of right are applications for extension of time within which to appeal after the court below has refused the application per rule 9, applications for stay of execution per rule 27 after the court below has refused that application, and application for stay of proceedings pending the determination of an interlocutory appeal per rule 27A of CI 19.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"Regarding the nullity of the writ, I believe counsel for Respondent has misjudged the effect of a judgment on appeal. And regarding the inappropriateness of this application, I see that counsel for Respondent has mis-appreciated the import of the provisions of CI 19 and the authorities that he is citing. First, the arguments concerning the nullity of the writ. If the Respondent counsel’s position that there is no writ existing in this suit because of the high court’s pronouncement that the writ in this context was void is upheld, it will lead to the absurd result that no court, either the high court, the court of appeal or the supreme court in its supervisory jurisdiction over the high court can address any issues pertaining to this case because of that judgment. However, it is trite learning that the potency of a judgment stands only in so far as it is not challenged on appeal and its execution stayed by an order of the court that gave the judgment or an appellate court.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"In the present case, the declaration of this writ as null and void has been challenged on appeal, and the judgment to the extent of restraining Applicant’s Counsel from representing it, stayed to enable the decision to be examined on appeal. In the order for stay of execution, this court also allowed Applicant counsel to prosecute the appeal, pending the determination of the propriety or otherwise of the orders in the judgment. Thus, the action commenced in the high court continues to be extremely active until all litigation raised pursuant thereto have been settled either to the satisfaction of the disputants, or by the last orders of the Supreme Court. This is the import of the machinery of justice. In the Ex parte Hesse case cited by Respondent counsel, the Supreme Court considered whether the filing of a notice of withdrawal of appeal ended the litigation commenced by the filing of a notice of appeal.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"The Court per Wood CJ clarified that to the extent that the court’s rules of procedure allowed for further steps to be taken after the withdrawal of appeal, the notice of withdrawal cannot be said to have ended the appeal. The court drew attention to the principle that in the construction of statutes, the proper approach is to adopt a subjective-purpose rule, which allows a court to accept the literalist, ordinary, plain, or grammatical meaning of the words of a statute only if it clearly advances the legislative purpose or intent and does not lead to any outrageous consequences. If the literal interpretation of a statute will lead to outrageous consequences, then a court is enjoined to examine the subjective purpose of the statute. What is the import of the complex arrangements made by the 1992 Constitution, the Courts Act and the various Rules of Procedure for Appeals and post judgment applications? They are to make sure that any action brought to court is kept alive for evaluation of the rightness of any decision unless all processes for establishing the final answer have been exhausted.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"It is within this context that I dismiss the underlined submission of Respondent counsel that ‘There is no writ pending and therefore Applicant’s application is incompetent’ The next point for consideration is whether this application is properly before this court. Clearly, the only place to look for a determination of whether the Court of Appeal can determine an application for injunction such as is before us is within its enabling statutes. CI 19 provides for various types of applications to be made to the Court of Appeal and orders to be made by the court in specific contexts. They include applications for extension of time within which to appeal under rule 9, orders for additional security for costs under rule 13, orders dismissing the appeal for non-compliance with various rules on the payment of deposits and securities, for withdrawal of appeals under rule 17, with or without costs, and all manner of orders and applications that the legislature deemed fit to make specific provision for. I have enumerated the above to show that the submission by counsel for Respondent on pages 2 and 3 of his submissions filed on 9th June 2016 that the only applications that the court of appeal can deal with before the transmission of the record of appeal are repeat applications for extension of time and stay of execution, and applications for stay of proceedings in the court below pending the determination of an interlocutory appeal, is untenable.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"Such an evaluation of the applications that the court of appeal can deal with before the transmission of proceedings is not at all supported by the law. In addition to various specific applications which may be addressed by the court before the record is transmitted, CI 19 also gives general powers to the court for various orders. This can be found under Rule 31 31\. General powers of the Court The Court shall generally have full jurisdiction over the whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted and prosecuted in the court as a court of first instance, and may Make an order necessary for determining the real question in controversy; Amend a defect or error in the record of appeal; Direct a notice of appeal to be served on all or any of the parties to the action or any other proceedings or on a person not a party, and may adjourn the hearing of an appeal on the terms that are just, and also make an order as if the person served with the notice had originally been a party to the appeal; Direct the court below to enquire into and certify its finding on a question which the court considers fit to determine before final judgment’ Make an interim order or grant an injunction which the court below is authorized to make or grant; and Direct any necessary enquiries or accounts to be made or taken Having established that the scope of applications that may be brought to the court of appeal before transmission of the records is so much broader than what learned counsel for Respondent has urged on this court, I must next look at how applications are to be presented to the Court of Appeal.

"It is therefore unfortunate that Respondent counsel’s submission missed this proper interpretation of the provisions made by CI 19 for the hearing of applications by the Court of Appeal. I do not see that the teaching of the learned author and jurist, Sir Justice Dennis Dominic Adjei on page 118 of his book Land Law, Practice and Conveyancing in Ghana, Adwinsa Publications (GH) Ltd 2015 as quoted by counsel for Respondent, supports the position espoused by him on page 3 of his submissions that ‘an application for injunction can only be entertained by the court of appeal when the court is properly seised with the appeal, that is, the record has been transmitted to the court of appeal’. Neither do I see how the facts and ratio in Republic v High court Kumasi: Ex Parte Sefa (Bank of Ghana Interested Party) (No 2); Republic v High Court, Kumasi: Ex Parte Gyamfi (Bank of Ghana Interested Party) (No 2) (Consolidated) 2013-2014) 1 SCGLR 512 can assist with the resolution of the present case. That decision concerned an application to the high court to set aside a default judgment granted by the high court when the decision of the high court earlier refusing that same application had been appealed in the Court of Appeal, affirmed, and the Court of Appeal decision appealed in the Supreme Court, and the appeal to the Supreme Court was awaiting decision. The facts of that case and the current case are poles apart and no principle from that case can be related to the current case.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"With this foundation, I will now examine whether or not the application in dispute is properly before us. Being an application for injunction, Rule 31 of CI 19 gives this court general power to deal with the application, rule 28 allows this court to deal with a repeat application from the high court, and section 12(b) of the Courts Act allows the court to vary, discharge or reverse an order for injunction made by a single Judge of the court of appeal. In the instant case, the application was first submitted to the high court, and repeated in the court of appeal. At the court of appeal, it was dealt with by a single judge and granted, subject to conditions. It is because the order of the single judge lapsed after 10 days owing to the non-fulfillment of the conditions attached to it that this court was disabled from examining on merit whether it is just and convenient for the court to vary, discharge, reverse or affirm the original grant by the single Judge.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"Is this matter res judicata just because the original application for injunction was granted by the single judge and lapsed after 10 days? Once again, I would say no.

"The critical requirement of a court in an application for injunction is to determine whether it is just and convenient to grant same. Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act allows the full court to look again at an order earlier made by a single judge. Rule 28 of CI 19 allows a party to repeat an application which was earlier presented to the court below for consideration of the full court of appeal. I am quite satisfied that the combined effects of Section 12 (b) of the Courts Act, rule 28 and 31 (e) of CI 19 give this court sufficient authority to admit the application as being in accordance with due process and consider it on its merit, given the fact that the original injunction order was made by a single judge of the court and lapsed after 10 days. I am also satisfied that the repetition of this application will not constitute an abuse of process because inter alia, this application addresses the reasons why the conditions attached to the first order could not be obeyed.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"I will now consider the application on its merits. The critical issue for this court to consider is whether on the strength of the pleadings, affidavits, exhibits and submissions brought to this court, it is just and convenient to grant this application without the conditions that the single Judge earlier attached to the order, because it is these conditions that caused the first order to lapse. The fact that the Applicant has thrown in ‘new material’ that its counsel says has been discovered since April 2016 does not detract from the fact that but for the conditions which the Applicant says were impracticable to fulfill, the earlier order would not have lapsed and this application could not be before us. Injunctions are equitable reliefs that serve the purpose of ensuring that the subject matter of a dispute is not endangered during the pendency of the dispute resolution. The general principle is that a court may exercise discretion to grant an application for injunction if the Applicant presents a case that is prima facie sustainable, not frivolous or vexatious and there is a real likelihood of irreparable damage being done to his interest in the subject matter of dispute if it is not protected from the acts complained of.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"There is a wealth of case law on the grounds for granting an order of injunction, several of which were cited by counsel for Applicants in his submission. My humble view is that it would be an unnecessary burden on this ruling to regurgitate them, especially when I have summarized the principles they lay down in the paragraph above. In granting the first order of injunction, this court per the single Judge, in order to keep the balance between the parties, directed the Applicant to retrieve the 1.2 Million Ghana Cedis ostensibly paid by the Respondent on behalf of the Applicant, while the Respondent moved out of the land in dispute. A close look at the pleadings exhibited show that from the commencement of this action, Applicant complained that it had not sanctioned the payment of that money by 1st Respondent to its own lawyer, and the Amakomhene, and had actually requested the return of the money to 1st Respondent because it did not agree to the transaction in issue. This, it claims, was as far back as September 2014.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E. N.

"The Applicant had also sought as part of its reliefs, an order of this court ‘for the return of the GH¢1,200,000 to the 1st Defendant’ Under such circumstances, it is certainly to be appreciated that the directive to ensure the return of the money it is seeking the court’s help to retrieve would have been herculean for it to achieve within the 10 day period. It is within this context that I find this repeat application to the court not a frivolous one, after the court had earlier granted the application on condition. But apart from that, I also see that it is just and convenient to hold a balance between the parties regarding retaining the integrity of title and physical condition of this land and property pending the resolution of the appeal, and this obviously was the leaning of the single judge when she earlier granted the injunction. The learned trial judge dismissed this suit without hearing it on the merits of the complaints per his evaluation of the import of Section 189 (3) of Act 179.

"Thus when a citizen’s case is knocked out on technical grounds without being heard, and he appeals, I believe a prima facie case is made out to hold the balance evenly between the parties while that preliminary issue concerning whether or not the case can be determined on its merits is examined. If the appellate courts considering this decision affirm it, the parties would have had their day in court as provided for by the Constitution. Thus this court must lean on the side of ensuring that the subject matter of the dispute is not unduly compromised before the dust settles. Within the action itself, I see that there are complex legal issues that require careful consideration of the justice of the cause of both parties if the writ survives the appeal. These complexities cover the validity of the transaction in issue, flowing from the Applicant’s complaints about the lawfulness of authorizations of the transaction in dispute under Company law and validity of the action, flowing from the trial court’s observations about the lawfulness of the authorization to commence this action under legal procedure and Company law; whether there was misrepresentation about the subject matter of the transaction and the considerations of the transaction, flowing from the complaints of the Applicant.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

"These are all complex issues in the law of contract, in Company law in procedure and the law of real property. With the investments allegedly made by the 1st Respondent, and the complaint about payment of consideration for the lease to the 2nd Respondent and not administrator of stool lands as alleged by Applicant, I am satisfied that irreversible harm may be done to the interest of either party if this court does not hold the interests of the parties in balance prior to a judicial enquiry into the issues of fact and law raised by the case, in the event that the appeal succeeds. Regarding on whose side irreversible harm will lie if the injunction is not granted prior to determination of the appeal, I do not find it difficult to determine that both parties stand in grave danger of severe losses if they are not kept away from causing irreparable change to the nature of the subject matter and the matter is decided in favor of either party at the end of the suit. It has already been demonstrated that when the first order was given by this court that the Respondent move from the site in dispute, it was able to obey the court’s order in a speedy fashion. Thus an order to the Respondent to restrain it from dealing with, disposing of, alienating and/or interfering, entering and/or remaining in occupation of the land in dispute pending the determination of the appeal should not be a matter of grave difficulty.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'H3/49/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['E.

Learned counsel for the appellants stated that there is no doubt that Morten Gode and Thornvaldsen Reider are directors of the respondent. Pages 38 to 43 of the record of appeal indicated the financial statement of the respondent company as Exhibit ‘A’ with the Directors and Ghacem Limited as 100% shareholders. Counsel also referred to Exhibit DM1 on pages 81 to 83 of the record of appeal which showed that Dominik Michel was appointed as Director in place of Reider Thorvaldsen and contended that the appellants cannot be faulted for invoking the jurisdiction of the court to attach their properties to satisfy the judgment debt dated 31/7/2015. Learned counsel referred to the definition of sequestration and contended that by the rules, the appellants were clothed with jurisdiction to apply with leave for a writ of sequestration against the Directors.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"47 on Enforcement of Judgment for payment of money.

Counsel finally submitted that the dismissal of the appellants’ application was most unfortunate and the Honourable trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion. Before I address the arguments as stated, I shall quote in extenso the relevant provisions of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (C.I. 47) namely, Order 43 rules 1(1), 5(1)(aa), 5(1)(bb), 5(1)(cc) and 12(1) respectively as follows:- “Order 43 rule (1).","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"Subject to these Rules, a judgment or order for the payment of money, not being a judgment or order for the payment into court, may be enforced by one or more of the following means: (a) Writ of fieri facias; (b) Garnishee proceedings; (c) A charging order (d) The appointment of a receiver; (e) In a case in which rule 5 applies, an order of committal or a writ of sequestration. 5(1) where (a) A person required by a judgment or order to do an act within a time specified in the judgment or order refuses or neglects to do it within that time or within that time as extended or reduced under Order 80 rule 4; or (b) A person disobeys a judgment or order requiring the person to abstain from doing an act, the judgment or order may subject to these Rules be enforced by one or more of the following means: (aa) a writ of sequestration against the property of that person with leave of the court; (bb) a writ of sequestration against the property of any director or other officer of the body where that person is a body corporate, with leave of the court; or (cc) an order of committal against that person or, where that person is a body corporate against any director or other officer. 12(1) Rule 1(1) of this Order with the omission of paragraph (e) and Orders 27, 44 to 47 and 49 shall apply to a judgment or order for the payment of money”.

At this stage, I wish to address the appellants’ initial complain that the learned trial judge was wrong in agreeing to the submission that the appellants left out the order under which their application was brought but upon moving the application they attempted to rely on Order 43 Rule 5(1)(bb) of C.I.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"In this capacity, a company is a corporate being, which, within the bounds of the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179) and its regulations may perform all the duties of a natural person. In its own name, it can sue and be sued and it can owe and be owed legal liabilities. A company once duly incorporated is thus a separate legal personality with a capacity separate, independent and distinct from its members and persons employed by it.

In the recent case of Soonboon Seo v Gateway Worship Centre \[2009\] SCGLR 278 Holding 4, the Supreme Court held succinctly that: “It is clear from the record of appeal that, the second-plaintiff church is a company limited by guarantee and incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179).","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"However, the legal personality and its distinct from its members and or directors can be ignored by law and the veil of incorporation could be lifted or pierced to ascribe liability to various individuals or corporations in exceptional circumstances that the company was established to further fraudulent activities, defeat public convenience, justify wrong to avoid contractual liability or defend crime among others. This is known as the alter ego doctrine. Indeed, the learned trial judge stated the law correctly in her Ruling at pages 210 and 211 of the record of appeal thus:- “I have looked at the plethora of cases that the counsel for the Directors of GHACEM rely on and also researched same and I must admit that it resonates so strongly within all these cases with clarity that a Limited Liability Company or Corporation has its legal existence apart from its Directors and members.

"The High Court dismissed the application and her appeal against the decision of the High Court to this Court was also dismissed by a majority decision. One of the grounds on which this court dismissed the appeal was that the circumstance of the case justified the lifting of the veil of incorporation surrounding the company and that both the company and the 2nd defendant could be held personally liable together with the 1st defendant company for the outstanding debts of the company. Not satisfied with the decision of this court, the 2nd defendant appealed to the Supreme Court. Counsel for the plaintiff argued in support of the decision of this court among others that the 2nd defendant had been sued because she was the chief executive who directed the day to day affairs of the defendant company. The Supreme Court held among others that since the 2nd defendant had been sued jointly with the company, a limited liability company for the only reason that she was the chief executive, main shareholder and a director of the company, she would be a proper party to the suit only if a specified personal liability were established against her or the veil of incorporation could be lifted to make her acts synonymous with those of the defendant company or vice versa.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"The Supreme Court considered whether or not a circumstance justifying the lifting of the veil existed depended on the peculiar facts driving each particular case. It however, pointed out that the mere fact that the 2nd defendant was at all times a shareholder, director and manager of the company was not enough to make her personally liable. The Supreme Court reacted to the statement of case by counsel for the 2nd plaintiff who explained that the 2nd defendant was joined “so as to ensure that the respondent collects his money”, the court stated that allowing the veil to be lifted to achieve such and end would mean that “every time a company defaults in the settlement of debts, any person who combines the role of chief executive, shareholder and director would, ipso facto, become personally liable.

"K. Deku \[2012\] 48 GMJ 186 CA. In the light of the authorities, it is clear that a court would not remove the veil of incorporation on the strength of mere assertions which cannot be strongly proved. Indeed, in the instant appeal, the learned trial judge held that mandatorily, any wrongdoing on the part of the company must be established to enable the court lift the veil in order that the ugly face of the erring company is seen. The trial judge further concluded that the appellants did not measure up to the mark by establishing any such wrong conduct on the part of the respondent company nor its directors to enable the veil to be lifted.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"In the instant appeal, the reasons given by the appellants for their application in the affidavit in support to have the veil lifted were among others that the respondents have willfully refused or neglected to pay the judgment debt, that they have not sighted any valuable movable and immovable properties to attach, that the directors/shareholders have sufficient funds and or properties but have willfully refused to pay, that the directors are aware of the judgment debt but continued filing applications to delay and thereby frustrate the appellants from realizing the full compliments of the judgment of the court and therefore the Directors, shareholders and other officers of the respondents should be attached. A perusal of the supplementary affidavit filed by the appellants reveal similar sentiments. A perusal of the grounds on which the appellants wanted the veil of incorporation to be lifted to make the directors to pay the judgment debt are baseless and flawed. There is no evidence that the respondents have established the company to further fraudulent activities or to avoid contractual liability, or have breached the Companies Act, Act 179 among others. From the record of appeal therefore the learned trial judge was right in dismissing the application since no evidence was established to prove that the company was established to further fraudulent activities among others.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

"This ground of appeal fails and it is dismissed as misconceived and incompetent. I now consider ground (iii) that is “The learned trial judge erred in her failure to give separate Rulings in respect of the application filed by the appellants herein and another application filed by the 3rd defendants seeking to pierce the Corporate Veil in aid of execution filed on 4/7/2016”. Learned Counsel for the appellants contended that the purpose of the two applications was aimed at levying execution against Ghacem Limited and the Directors of the respondent Company, the Trial judge ought to have given separate Rulings on the two applications having regards to the fact that they were filed by different parties and under different Rules of Court. Counsel submitted that it is trite that in situations where cases are even consolidated separate judgments are delivered and that the delivery of a single Ruling in respect of two separate applications initiated by different parties was wrong and amounted to travesty of justice. The learned trial judge resolved both applications in the same ruling at page 209 of the Ruling as follows:- “I intend to resolve the two applications before this Court i.e.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'HI/5/2018', 'type': 'CIVIL APPEAL'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MR.

It implies therefore that the defendants’ averment in paragraph 12 of their statement of defence that the defendants “do not owe the plaintiffs any money and that whatever work they did was fully paid for” cannot be correct. In the opinion of the court if it is true that the defendants have fully paid for the work done by the plaintiffs then it is the duty of the defence to adduce credible evidence to prove that allegation in accordance with sections 14 and 17 of the Evidence Act 1975, NRCD 323.

"This rule is further buttressed by section 17 (b) which, emphasizes on the party on whom lies the duty to start leading evidence…” From the evidence adduced the court holds that the defendants have failed to prove that they do not owe the plaintiffs for the works done by the plaintiffs on the instructions of the 2nd defendant. The court is satisfied from the pleadings and the evidence on record that the defendants are indebted to the plaintiffs for the works which the plaintiffs executed for the defendants based on the request which the 2nd defendant made to the 1st plaintiff per exhibit A. From the endorsement on the writ of summons, it is clear that the plaintiffs are not claiming, as part of their reliefs, the difference between the bill in exhibit C which is ₵67,516,350 and the amount actually paid to them by the defendants which is stated to be ₵10,000,000. By calculation the difference will be ₵57,516,350 which translates into GH₵5,752. However, notwithstanding the failure of the plaintiffs in couching a claim for the difference as stated herein, there are authorities to the effect that once there is evidence on record in support of the said claim, the court has power to give judgment in favour of the claim.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"1 page 90 para. 2-002 defines an offer “as an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed’ According to the authors, “Under the objective test of agreement, an apparent intention to be bound may suffice, i.e. the alleged offeror may be bound if his words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable person to believe that he intends to be bound, even though in fact he has no such intention” In her book The Law of Contract in Ghana (2011), published by Frontiers Printing and Publishing Company, Ghana the learned author, Dowuona-Hammond, states at para. 2 page 18 that “an offer may be defined as a statement or conduct indicating a willingness to contract on terms stated or on terms which can reasonably be inferred from conduct, and made with the intention that it will become binding as soon as it is accepted” In NTHC Ltd vs. Antwi \[2009\] SCGLR 117 at 125 the Supreme Court stated that: “an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms” The court is of the opinion that once it is shown that the 1st plaintiff either accepted, in writing, the terms in exhibit E or acted upon the directives in exhibit E, a contract can legitimately be inferred.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"The defendants have strenuously argued that there was no formal agreement between the parties and that the procedure set out in the Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663) was not observed. The court finds it difficult to appreciate what the defendants meant by formal agreement. The court is, however, of the opinion that exhibits E and F constitute a formal contract between the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. There is no law that a formal contract between parties must be contained in one document. Once the parties have exchanged documents detailing the terms of their agreement, the documents together constitute the contract between the parties.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Even if the contract was just a verbal one it could still be enforced. At common law contracts could be formal or informal and except a statute specifically says so, contracts entered into by verbal agreements are enforceable. For instance, there is a specific requirement under section 14 of the Contracts Act 1960, Act 25 that makes it mandatory that a contract of guarantee must be in writing and signed by the guarantor in order to be valid. Again, as an example, the Conveyancing Act 1975, NRCD 175 provides in section 2 as follows “A contract for the transfer of an interest in land is not enforceable unless (a) it is evidenced in a writing signed by the person against whom the contract is to be proved or by a person who was authorised to sign on behalf of that person, or (b) it is relieved against the need for a writing by section 3.” Even then, in Fofie vs. Zanyo (supra) it was pointed out at page 477 of the report that “The court was entitled in certain cases to permit a contract to be proved by oral evidence, even though of a kind required to be proved in writing, when the party seeking to enforce the contract had done acts in performance of his obligations under it.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"The court would exercise its discretion where (a) the act of part performance was referable to only the contract alleged; (b) they were such as would render it a fraud in the defendant to take advantage of the contract not being in writing; (c) the contract by its own nature was enforceable by the court; and (d) there had to be proper parol evidence of the contract let in by the act of part performance.” In the instant case however, the contract between the plaintiffs and the 2nd defendant was not oral but in writing as shown by exhibits E and F. At any rate at the time the parties entered into the agreement, there was no specific law that such contracts ought to be in writing before they could be enforced or recognized at law. As was held in Kobaku Associates vs. Owusu \[2003-2005\] 1 GLR 611 “A contract between an architect and a client was not required to be in writing and therefore under section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 (Act 25) would not be void simply because it was not written. Moreover, on the authorities, where there was no express contract with architects (and engineers) the right to remuneration was implied by the request and acceptance of the plans produced, except where there was evidence that the plans were to be merely submitted for approval, in which case they were deemed to be probationary drawing constituting an offer from the architect.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"And as soon as the plans were accepted the right to remuneration would arise.” As explained, it is only when one could find a statute requiring that a particular type of contract must be in writing that a written contract becomes mandatory for the enforcement of that particular type of contracts. Hence, in the absence of a statute making it mandatory for particular contracts to be in writing, agreements verbally reached by parties, all other requirements being present, are as enforceable as their written counterparts. Indeed, that is the essence of section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 Act 25 when it states that “11. Contracts need not be in writing except in certain cases Subject to this Act, and to any other enactment, a contract whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, is not void or unenforceable by reason only that it is not in writing or that there is no memorandum or note of the contract in writing.” As already indicated above, the plaintiffs had proved, by exhibits G series, among others, that they had discharged their obligations under the contract. Indeed, exhibits G series were prepared only in response to the request by the 2nd defendant contained in exhibit E that the 1st plaintiff prepares Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"One may legitimately ask whether it would not be fraudulent on the part of the defendants to refuse to pay the plaintiffs, after benefiting from the works executed by the plaintiffs, on the ground that there is no agreement just because the terms are not contained in a single document. Section 26 of the Evidence Act 1975 NRCD 323 is apt on this issue. It states that “Except as otherwise provided by law, including a rule of equity, when a party has, by that party’s own statement, act or omission, intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon that belief, the truth of the thing shall be conclusively presumed against that party or the successors in interest of that party in proceedings between (a) that party or the successors in interest of that party, and (b) the relying person or successors in interest of that person.” The defendants have admitted writing exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff. In exhibit E the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tendering Documents “prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats…” and also “present detailed Bills of Quantities for consideration” The 1st plaintiff, in response, wrote exhibit F and thereafter, together with 2nd plaintiff prepared and submitted to 2nd defendant, exhibits G series in the discharge of their obligations under exhibit E. The relevant portion of exhibit G in particular states as follows: “REHABILITATION OF UNDP FLATS We refer to your letter dated 27th February 2003 and wish to inform you that Tender documents for the above project are ready.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"We forward herewith one (1) copy each of the Approximate Bills of Quantities for your study and further direction” In the opinion of the court it would be fraudulent in the defendant to say that they would not pay the plaintiffs because there is absence of a single document containing the terms of the plaintiffs’ engagement. The defendants are surely estopped by their conduct. The defendants have argued that the plaintiffs did not go through the laid down procedures in obtaining the contract and that the proper authority did not authorize the execution of the contract. The defendants have, in their addresses, made reference to the need for an advertisement in the newspapers inviting tenders, the need for the plaintiffs to submit their bids, the need for evaluation and other procedures which should have been gone through before the award of the contract. Unfortunately, the defendants failed to mention the law which requires all these procedures to be followed before such contracts are awarded.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"It seems to the court that the defendant had in mind the Public Procurement Act, 2003 Act 663, which sets out in part six, sections 66 to 77, the methods and procedures to be followed before the services of Consultants were engaged by agencies and departments of Government. It ought however to be pointed out that Act 663 received Presidential assent after the contract, subject of this suit, had been entered and for that matter this Act does not operate retrospectively to regulate the contract, subject matter of this suit. Another issue which engaged the attention of the defendants at the trial was the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants had, in effect, argued that the fee payable to the plaintiffs, being the consideration for the works done, was not known at the time the parties entered the agreement and so there was no contract upon which the plaintiffs could sue. The plaintiffs’ explanation, which the defendants did not challenge and which the court has also no reason to reject, is that the Ministry of Works and Housing has a scale of fees, expressed as a percentage of the value of the contract sum and that whenever a contract was awarded the Consultants are presumed to have accepted the scale of fees agreed and approved by the Ministry.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"The amount endorsed on the writ and claimed by the plaintiffs is GH₵552,146.46. This claim is supported by exhibit V the bill of fees which the plaintiffs submitted to the 2nd defendants for payment. It appears that when the defendants disputed the fees, the plaintiffs obtained an assessment of their fees from the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, exhibit X herein which fixed the plaintiffs’ fees at US$265,666.52. The defendants also obtained an assessment of the plaintiffs’ fees from the Architectural and Engineering Services Limited, exhibit 1 herein, which fixed the fees at US$181,778.94. Apart from there being no reason for the court to accept any of the fees quoted in exhibits X and 1, over the fees being claimed by the plaintiffs, the court finds that a conservative conversion of the amounts quoted in these exhibits from the dollar into the Ghana Cedis would far exceed the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"It therefore makes good sense to accept the amount endorsed on the writ. There is yet one final issue which, although was not specifically raised by the defendants, the court wishes to discuss before concluding on this matter. At paragraph 1 of the statement of claim, the 1st plaintiff describes itself as a “sole proprietorship”, yet the writ is issued in the name of the 1st plaintiff which is only a business name which lacks capacity to sue as if it were a legal entity. The court is of the view that it has enough powers to effect an amendment of the capacity in which the 1st plaintiff had sued in order that the real issue in controversy between the parties is determined and not defeated by a mere technicality.

Amendment of other documents (1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties or of correcting any defect or error in the proceedings, the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings either of its own motion or on the application of any party, order any document in the proceedings to be amended on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner as it may direct. (2) This rule shall not apply in relation to a judgment or order.” This rule had long been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority vs. Issoufou \[1993-1994\] 1 GLR 24 where the court reiterated the law that “The courts had a duty to ensure that justice was done in cases before them and should not let that duty be circumvented by mere technicalities.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Since the power to make amendments to the capacity of a party rested in the inherent jurisdiction of the courts, the courts could, when the issue was raised either in the trial court any time after judgment was delivered or in the appellate court on the application of a party to the suit, orally or otherwise, grant such amendments as were necessary to meet the justice of the case.” The evidence before the court shows that the 1st plaintiff is owned and operated by Yaw Banning Darko who describes himself as the Chief Executive Officer of the 1st plaintiff. Indeed all the correspondence from the 1st plaintiff, which was tendered in evidence, was signed by Yaw Banning Darko. On the strength of the authorities therefore the writ will be amended by amending the name of the 1st plaintiff to read “Yaw Banning Darko operating under the name Dakab Consult.” Finally, the court holds that the plaintiffs are entitled to their claims against the defendants. Judgment is therefore entered for the plaintiffs to recover from the defendants the sum of GH₵552,146.46 together with interest at the prevailing rate from 18th May 2011, the date on which the 1st plaintiff wrote his bill to the 2nd defendant to the date of final payment.

The court is satisfied from the pleadings and the evidence on record that the defendants are indebted to the plaintiffs for the works which the plaintiffs executed for the defendants based on the request which the 2nd defendant made to the 1st plaintiff per exhibit A.

"In addition to the works done by the plaintiffs on the strength of exhibit A, the court finds that on the 27th February 2003, the 2nd defendant again authorized the 1st plaintiff to “prepare tendering documents prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats with the view to rectifying electrical, mechanical, structural and architectural defects to upgrade the standard of the flats to attract higher rental value”. Further, the 2nd defendant authorized the 1st plaintiff to prepare and present to it, Bills of Quantities for the consideration of the 2nd defendant. These facts which are supported by exhibit E tendered by the plaintiffs are pleaded in paragraph 9 of the plaintiffs’ statement of claim. Not surprisingly, the defendants have admitted these facts in paragraph 8 of their statement of defence. The court finds that in response to the 2nd defendant’s letter of 27th February 2003 the 1st plaintiff wrote an acknowledgement dated 28th February 2003, exhibit F herein and undertook to present to the 2nd defendant detailed Bills of Quantities for its consideration.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"The defendants say that they are not indebted to the plaintiffs for the reason that the plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence of a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. Indeed, in their evidence in chief and throughout the trial, the defendants’ defence is that there is no contract between them and the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs have failed to furnish documentary evidence of any contract between the parties so the defendants are not indebted to the plaintiffs. The defendants’ contention that the plaintiffs “have failed to produce any evidence of any alleged contractual relationship with the Ministry” comes to the court as a great surprise. This is so because, as pointed out above, the defendants have, in paragraph 8 of their statement of defence, admitted that the 2nd defendant wrote exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff in which the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering.

"The authors in Chitty on Contracts (28th ed.) published by Sweet and Maxwell (1999) Vol. 1 page 90 para. 2-002 defines an offer “as an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed’ According to the authors, “Under the objective test of agreement, an apparent intention to be bound may suffice, i.e. the alleged offeror may be bound if his words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable person to believe that he intends to be bound, even though in fact he has no such intention” In her book The Law of Contract in Ghana (2011), published by Frontiers Printing and Publishing Company, Ghana the learned author, Dowuona-Hammond, states at para. 2 page 18 that “an offer may be defined as a statement or conduct indicating a willingness to contract on terms stated or on terms which can reasonably be inferred from conduct, and made with the intention that it will become binding as soon as it is accepted” In NTHC Ltd vs.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

See Fofie vs. Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475.

"The court therefore holds that there exist a contract between, at least, the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. The defendants have strenuously argued that there was no formal agreement between the parties and that the procedure set out in the Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663) was not observed. The court finds it difficult to appreciate what the defendants meant by formal agreement. The court is, however, of the opinion that exhibits E and F constitute a formal contract between the 1st plaintiff and the 2nd defendant.

"Once the parties have exchanged documents detailing the terms of their agreement, the documents together constitute the contract between the parties. Even if the contract was just a verbal one it could still be enforced. At common law contracts could be formal or informal and except a statute specifically says so, contracts entered into by verbal agreements are enforceable. For instance, there is a specific requirement under section 14 of the Contracts Act 1960, Act 25 that makes it mandatory that a contract of guarantee must be in writing and signed by the guarantor in order to be valid. Again, as an example, the Conveyancing Act 1975, NRCD 175 provides in section 2 as follows “A contract for the transfer of an interest in land is not enforceable unless (a) it is evidenced in a writing signed by the person against whom the contract is to be proved or by a person who was authorised to sign on behalf of that person, or (b) it is relieved against the need for a writing by section 3.” Even then, in Fofie vs.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Zanyo (supra) it was pointed out at page 477 of the report that “The court was entitled in certain cases to permit a contract to be proved by oral evidence, even though of a kind required to be proved in writing, when the party seeking to enforce the contract had done acts in performance of his obligations under it. The court would exercise its discretion where (a) the act of part performance was referable to only the contract alleged; (b) they were such as would render it a fraud in the defendant to take advantage of the contract not being in writing; (c) the contract by its own nature was enforceable by the court; and (d) there had to be proper parol evidence of the contract let in by the act of part performance.” In the instant case however, the contract between the plaintiffs and the 2nd defendant was not oral but in writing as shown by exhibits E and F. At any rate at the time the parties entered into the agreement, there was no specific law that such contracts ought to be in writing before they could be enforced or recognized at law. As was held in Kobaku Associates vs. Owusu \[2003-2005\] 1 GLR 611 “A contract between an architect and a client was not required to be in writing and therefore under section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 (Act 25) would not be void simply because it was not written.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Moreover, on the authorities, where there was no express contract with architects (and engineers) the right to remuneration was implied by the request and acceptance of the plans produced, except where there was evidence that the plans were to be merely submitted for approval, in which case they were deemed to be probationary drawing constituting an offer from the architect. And as soon as the plans were accepted the right to remuneration would arise.” As explained, it is only when one could find a statute requiring that a particular type of contract must be in writing that a written contract becomes mandatory for the enforcement of that particular type of contracts. Hence, in the absence of a statute making it mandatory for particular contracts to be in writing, agreements verbally reached by parties, all other requirements being present, are as enforceable as their written counterparts. Indeed, that is the essence of section 11 of the Contracts Act, 1960 Act 25 when it states that “11. Contracts need not be in writing except in certain cases Subject to this Act, and to any other enactment, a contract whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, is not void or unenforceable by reason only that it is not in writing or that there is no memorandum or note of the contract in writing.” As already indicated above, the plaintiffs had proved, by exhibits G series, among others, that they had discharged their obligations under the contract.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Indeed, exhibits G series were prepared only in response to the request by the 2nd defendant contained in exhibit E that the 1st plaintiff prepares Tender Documents and Bills of Quantities in respect of the renovation of the UNDP flats at Cantonments prior to tendering. One may legitimately ask whether it would not be fraudulent on the part of the defendants to refuse to pay the plaintiffs, after benefiting from the works executed by the plaintiffs, on the ground that there is no agreement just because the terms are not contained in a single document. Section 26 of the Evidence Act 1975 NRCD 323 is apt on this issue. It states that “Except as otherwise provided by law, including a rule of equity, when a party has, by that party’s own statement, act or omission, intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon that belief, the truth of the thing shall be conclusively presumed against that party or the successors in interest of that party in proceedings between (a) that party or the successors in interest of that party, and (b) the relying person or successors in interest of that person.” The defendants have admitted writing exhibit E to the 1st plaintiff. In exhibit E the 2nd defendant requested the 1st plaintiff to prepare Tendering Documents “prior to tendering process towards rehabilitation of the UNDP flats…” and also “present detailed Bills of Quantities for consideration” The 1st plaintiff, in response, wrote exhibit F and thereafter, together with 2nd plaintiff prepared and submitted to 2nd defendant, exhibits G series in the discharge of their obligations under exhibit E.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"In the opinion of the court it would be unfair, unjust, inequitable, and unconscionable to deprive the plaintiffs of their remuneration. It seems to the court that the defendant had in mind the Public Procurement Act, 2003 Act 663, which sets out in part six, sections 66 to 77, the methods and procedures to be followed before the services of Consultants were engaged by agencies and departments of Government. It ought however to be pointed out that Act 663 received Presidential assent after the contract, subject of this suit, had been entered and for that matter this Act does not operate retrospectively to regulate the contract, subject matter of this suit. Another issue which engaged the attention of the defendants at the trial was the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. The defendants had, in effect, argued that the fee payable to the plaintiffs, being the consideration for the works done, was not known at the time the parties entered the agreement and so there was no contract upon which the plaintiffs could sue.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"The plaintiffs’ explanation, which the defendants did not challenge and which the court has also no reason to reject, is that the Ministry of Works and Housing has a scale of fees, expressed as a percentage of the value of the contract sum and that whenever a contract was awarded the Consultants are presumed to have accepted the scale of fees agreed and approved by the Ministry. The amount endorsed on the writ and claimed by the plaintiffs is GH₵552,146.46. This claim is supported by exhibit V the bill of fees which the plaintiffs submitted to the 2nd defendants for payment. It appears that when the defendants disputed the fees, the plaintiffs obtained an assessment of their fees from the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, exhibit X herein which fixed the plaintiffs’ fees at US$265,666.52. The defendants also obtained an assessment of the plaintiffs’ fees from the Architectural and Engineering Services Limited, exhibit 1 herein, which fixed the fees at US$181,778.94.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Apart from there being no reason for the court to accept any of the fees quoted in exhibits X and 1, over the fees being claimed by the plaintiffs, the court finds that a conservative conversion of the amounts quoted in these exhibits from the dollar into the Ghana Cedis would far exceed the amount being claimed by the plaintiffs. It therefore makes good sense to accept the amount endorsed on the writ. There is yet one final issue which, although was not specifically raised by the defendants, the court wishes to discuss before concluding on this matter. At paragraph 1 of the statement of claim, the 1st plaintiff describes itself as a “sole proprietorship”, yet the writ is issued in the name of the 1st plaintiff which is only a business name which lacks capacity to sue as if it were a legal entity. The court is of the view that it has enough powers to effect an amendment of the capacity in which the 1st plaintiff had sued in order that the real issue in controversy between the parties is determined and not defeated by a mere technicality.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Indeed, Order 16 rule 7 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2004, CI. 47, gives the court the power to amend suo motu. It provides that “7.

"Issoufou \[1993-1994\] 1 GLR 24 where the court reiterated the law that “The courts had a duty to ensure that justice was done in cases before them and should not let that duty be circumvented by mere technicalities. Since the power to make amendments to the capacity of a party rested in the inherent jurisdiction of the courts, the courts could, when the issue was raised either in the trial court any time after judgment was delivered or in the appellate court on the application of a party to the suit, orally or otherwise, grant such amendments as were necessary to meet the justice of the case.” The evidence before the court shows that the 1st plaintiff is owned and operated by Yaw Banning Darko who describes himself as the Chief Executive Officer of the 1st plaintiff. Indeed all the correspondence from the 1st plaintiff, which was tendered in evidence, was signed by Yaw Banning Darko. On the strength of the authorities therefore the writ will be amended by amending the name of the 1st plaintiff to read “Yaw Banning Darko operating under the name Dakab Consult.” Finally, the court holds that the plaintiffs are entitled to their claims against the defendants. Judgment is therefore entered for the plaintiffs to recover from the defendants the sum of GH₵552,146.46 together with interest at the prevailing rate from 18th May 2011, the date on which the 1st plaintiff wrote his bill to the 2nd defendant to the date of final payment.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.

"Contract has been defined as ‘a promise or set of promises which the law will enforce’.

A contract therefore comes into being when there had been an exchange of promises between two or more parties or when a promise had been given in exchange for the performance of an act. What needs to be present for any agreement to be enforceable is one whether there had been a promise by one party.

"And if there is an offer whether the offer has unconditionally been accepted. And if it has been accepted whether from the nature of the whole transaction there was an intention to create legal relations.

"It is important to emphasize the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. I will hold and find that Ex ‘DD’ emanating from the plaintiff to the defendant will constitute a valid offer that was made to the defendant. Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}"

One may ask, which issues? He himself had no clue as to the issues and little wonder could not even state one for the consideration of the court.

This submission of learned counsel for defendant on the use of approval and not acceptance, with profound respect, was extremely pedestrian and peripheral. For in the case of FOFIE v ZANYO \[1992\] 2 GLR 475 the Supreme Court noted, among others, that acceptance of an offer must be some form of positive evidence by words, in writing or conduct from which acceptance can reasonably be inferred, the acceptance would have to be communicated to the offeror and that there was no need for specific method of acceptance of an offer.

"The answer of the court on non-approval of the deal by defendant’s shareholders’ can simply be answered by the rule in Turquand’s case. That is ROYAL BRITISH BANK v TURQUAND \[1843-60\] ALL ER 435. The rule is to the effect that people transacting with companies are entitled to assume that internal company rules are complied with, even if they are not. This rule was later affirmed in the case of MAHONEY v EAST HOLIFORD MINING COM. \[1975\] LR HL 869’ where Lord Hetherly noted as follows: “When there are persons conducting the affairs of the company in a manner which appears to be perfectly consonant with the articles of association, those so dealing with them externally are not to be affected by irregularities which may take place in the internal management of the company”.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}"
"This has been the position of the Ghana’s Company, Act 179 where under section 137 it states as follows: “A company shall act through its members in general meeting or its board of directors or through officers or agents, appointed by, or under authority derived from, the members in general meeting or the board of directors. (2) Subject to the provisions of this Code, the respective powers of the members in general meeting and the board of directors shall be determined by the company's Regulations. (3) Except as otherwise provided in the company's Regulations, the business of the company shall be managed by the board of directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Code or the Regulations required to be exercised by the members in general meeting”. I find and hold that the Board of Directors having communicated their unfettered acceptance of the offer of the plaintiff, it lies not in the mouth of the defendant to turn round to claim that their acceptance had not been approved by the shareholders’.

"Now to the claim of the transaction being subject to Bank of Ghana’s approval. The relevant portion for our dealing is section 20(1) of the Non-Banking Financial Act, Act 774 which states as follows: “(1) A non-bank financial institution shall submit to the Bank for approval, any proposal or agreement which it intends to enter into with another party for the sale or disposal by amalgamation or otherwise of its business, or a part of its business. (2) Subject to prior written approval of the Bank (a) a non-bank financial institution may, other than in the ordinary course of its business, sell the whole or part of its assets in the country to another licensed non-bank financial institution” From the evidence on record it has not been the case of the defendant that bank of Ghana did not approve the transaction. If it had not then the defendant would have pleaded frustration. The Central Bank only asked for shareholders’ approval which defendant had negligently failed to procure and why should plaintiff suffer for defendant’s own lapses when plaintiff per the Turquand’s rule was perfectly entitled in law to assume that the internal preconditions have been complied with.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}"
"This ground must also fail. Ipso facto then, the alleged holding of an annual general meeting by the defendant after a valid, binding contract had come into force does amount, to a blatant breach of the contract with the plaintiff that had come into being between the parties. I need not say more on this issue as my analysis on the first issue makes any further discussion moot. Again, by the principle as expounded in the Torquand’s case, Mahoney, sections 137, 140 of the Companies Act, Act 179, the Board of Directors of defendant by accepting the offer of plaintiff, in law had fully represented to the plaintiff that all the necessary precondition to enable a binding contract come into being had been obtained by them. The sections earlier quoted in Act 179 could only be supplemented by section 142 which states as follows: “Any person having dealings with a company or with someone deriving title under the company shall be entitled to make the following assumptions, that is to say, (a) that the company's Regulations have been duly complied with; Again see MAHONEY case supra.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}"

Plaintiff concludes that this has caused him severe anxiety and distress and hence the reliefs it seeks before the court. Defendant has denied the essential averments made by the Plaintiff. Defendant claim that the cause of the fire per its investigations was a smoke from a faulty electronic connector to the battery positive terminal unit and contend that with the exact cause of the fire known the Plaintiff cannot claim to rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor. Defendant claim that the vehicles recalled worldwide did not include the vehicle of Plaintiff.

"EVALUATION OF THE EVIDENCE I begin the evaluation with the first issue raised in the issues set down for determination which is, whether or not the vehicle was damaged as a result of the Defendant’s negligence. I combine this with the fourth issue regarding whether or not the defect found on the vehicle was a manufacturer’s defect. It must be clarified that looking at the pleadings and the evidence during trial I glean two disparate allegations of negligence levelled by plaintiff which he is under a duty to prove them. The first leg of negligence I see is the claim by Plaintiff that Defendant failed in ensuring that the vehicle purchased did not have any latent or manufacturers defect and the second allegation of negligence is in relation to the flooding Accra in June 2015 that affected the vehicle of Plaintiff. The first leg of claim of negligence situate it more within the sale of goods and whether the vehicle sold to Plaintiff’s Chief Executive Officer was fit for purpose and free from defects which were not declared and known to the buyer.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'CM/0103/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF – SAMANTHA CARBOO FOR RANDALL OBENG-SAYKI  \r', 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT – ALFRED ENYAAH FOR PETER ZWENNES'], 'combinedParties': ['WIREN INTERNATIONAL GH LTD - (PLAINTIFF)', 'MECHANICAL LLYOD CO.

(b). Where the goods are of a description which are supplied by the seller in the course of his business and the buyer expressly or by implication makes known the purpose for which the goods are required there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose”. What the provision means is that Ghana’s Sale of Goods Act, has moved away from the common law position of caveat emptor where the buyer must beware to one of caveat glovoson, where the seller must beware of the goods he is selling.

Defendant concede that the vehicle had done just over 10,000 km and yet having been in the hands of Plaintiff’s director for almost five years, it should not be seen only in terms of mileage as brand new.

A party is entitled to a claim if a latent defect was to be discovered within a reasonable time after purchase. What is latent defect has been defined in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary (5th ed, Vol 2, page 663) as: “A latent defect is not simply any defect not discoverable through ordinary use and maintenance, but a defect or a flaw, generally in the metal or material itself, which could not be discovered by known and customary test.” No wonder that on average, a two year warranty is provided the buyer, by which time it is conceivable that any hidden defect would have been discovered, but such a warranty was not meant to subsist ad infinitum during the entire lifetime of the use of the vehicle. The warranty will not cover a vehicle used for almost five years despite its low mileage as what may cause a defect may not just be the constant use of the vehicle but even how it is handled or kept which may not be shown by the mileage on the vehicle.

This then leads the court to the resolution of the claim for damages for loss use of the vehicle that Plaintiff is claim. Plaintiff per relief d claim damages for loss of use of the vehicle from November 6 till date of receipt of the full value of the vehicle. The Plaintiff’s representative in his evidence in chief at paragraphs 32 and 33 provides further particulars of the claim for damages for the loss of use of the vehicle. Plaintiff claim that the daily rental value of such a vehicle is $300.00 a day and the Plaintiff’s CEO had to suffer the indignity of borrowing vehicles from his children and other officers to conduct his business.

From the evidence it was not only the Defendant’s workshop that was flooded but other shops such as PHC Motors, Toyota etc.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'CM/0103/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF – SAMANTHA CARBOO FOR RANDALL OBENG-SAYKI  \r', 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT – ALFRED ENYAAH FOR PETER ZWENNES'], 'combinedParties': ['WIREN INTERNATIONAL GH LTD - (PLAINTIFF)', 'MECHANICAL LLYOD CO.

Many parts of Accra were flooded and there could have been human factors involved that exacerbated the havoc caused by the rains. I cannot however find that something special or extraordinary was expected of the Defendant to have insulated it from the flood. I will therefore find as a fact that the flooding of Defendant’s premises where the vehicle of Plaintiff was kept thereby causing damage to the vehicle was an act of God. Even if this finding is wrong it does not matter.

"Defendant has repaired the vehicle free of charge way after the warranty had expired and had notified the Plaintiff to come for the vehicle but had refused more than three months before the flood. In that circumstance, Defendant bore no obligation to the Plaintiff as the vehicle was kept with the Defendant at Plaintiff’s own risk. I am not unmindful that attempts were made to amicably settle the matter, whereupon the parties commissioned Intercity STC to value the vehicle which was done as shown in Exhibit ‘F’. Plaintiff was however not happy with the value and commissioned his own independent valuation in Exhibit ‘G’ where Assenta Properties put the open market value at €60,000.00 and forced sale value at €48,000.00. This second valuation at the instance of Plaintiff could be said to be self-serving.","{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'CM/0103/2016', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF – SAMANTHA CARBOO FOR RANDALL OBENG-SAYKI  \r', 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT – ALFRED ENYAAH FOR PETER ZWENNES'], 'combinedParties': ['WIREN INTERNATIONAL GH LTD - (PLAINTIFF)', 'MECHANICAL LLYOD CO.

"The attempt at settlement before court and even in the course of trial was totally without prejudice and could not be said to bind the Defendant. For good business practice and to retain an abiding client, a business entity may decide to give more than what the law requires and that cannot be used as evidence of liability. On the whole, I find the claims of Plaintiff unproved and not meriting an award of the court for the reliefs claimed. I accordingly dismiss the claim of Plaintiff in its entirety.
