"Can the liability of a subsidiary company be extended to a parent company
","However, the legal personality and its distinct from its members and or directors can be ignored by law and the veil of incorporation could be lifted or pierced to ascribe liability to various individuals or corporations in exceptional circumstances that the company was established to further fraudulent activities, defeat public convenience, justify wrong to avoid contractual liability or defend crime among others. This is known as the alter ego doctrine. Indeed, the learned trial judge stated the law correctly in her Ruling at pages 210 and 211 of the record of appeal thus:- “I have looked at the plethora of cases that the counsel for the Directors of GHACEM rely on and also researched same and I must admit that it resonates so strongly within all these cases with clarity that a Limited Liability Company or Corporation has its legal existence apart from its Directors and members. It also echoes throughout those cases that seldom will the veil be lifted unless it can be proven in exceptional circumstances that the company has been established to further fraudulent activities to avoid contractual liability.

"legal opinion on force majeure
","\[35\] Her behavior to my mind raises a supplemental question which is whether or not this Court should endorse such an approach where a citizen of this Republic is allowed to take the law into his or her hands to prevent another from performing his lawful official duty when there is no legal injunction or impediment under the guise of protecting “his space”; and if an injury occurs as in this case the same belligerent person then comes to the Court to seek damages. To my mind the Court should not endorse such a behavior because that would potentially render our society to the dynamics of a Hobbesian state of anarchy and chaos. \[36\] Finally, I am grateful to both Counsel for their assistance.
