What is a valid offer?,"And if there is an offer whether the offer has unconditionally been accepted. And if it has been accepted whether from the nature of the whole transaction there was an intention to create legal relations. Indeed in the case of NTHC v YAA ANTWI \[2009\] SCGLR 117 this is how the learned Justice Date-Bah defined a valid offer and acceptance in a case where Ms Antwi had communicated her acceptance of an offer to sell a house she was living in to her and had not even paid the money long after the communication: “Basically, an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms. Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation. By significant, we here mean terms that are essential to the bargain contemplated.",1.5871663,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}","It is important to emphasize the proposition that the mere acceptance of an offer is sufficient to turn the offer into a contract, if there is consideration for it, together with an intention to create legal relations. I will hold and find that Ex ‘DD’ emanating from the plaintiff to the defendant will constitute a valid offer that was made to the defendant. Again applying the test as to acceptance, the offer of the plaintiff was not rejected by the defendant, neither was there a counter offer nor a demand or clarification for further information. Ex ‘EE’ was clear, in in its acceptance as it provided the purchase price per share, the amount of shares being accepted for the sale etc. If this cannot constitute acceptance of an offer, then what else can constitute acceptance.",1.5600421,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'AC/07/2014', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedParties': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED -(PLAINTIFF)', 'FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD - (DEFENDANT)'], 'counsel': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': [], 'Defendant/Respondent': []}, 'court': {'location': {'city': 'ACCRA', 'country': 'GHANA'}, 'name': 'HIGH COURTCOMMERCIAL DIVISION'}, 'editorialNote': None, 'headNotes': None, 'indices': [], 'judgement': {'date': '2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z', 'year': 2016, 'month': 'July', 'day': 26}, 'judges': ['HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT'], 'lawReportsCitations': [], 'mediaNeutralCitation': None, 'natureOfProceedings': None, 'partiesOfSuit': {'Plaintiff/Appellant': ['GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED'], 'Defendant/Respondent': ['FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD']}, 'presidingJudge': 'HIS LORDSHIP ERIC KYEI BAFFOUR JUSTICE OF THE HIGH COURT', 'source': 'lawsghana.com', 'sourceFile': '\\original_source_files\\Courts-20230120T154617Z-001\\Courts\\High Court\\2016\\766.html', 'statutesReferredTo': [], 'title': {'long': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED. vs. FIRST GHANA SAVINGS & LOANS LTD', 'short': 'GHANA HOME LOANS LIMITED vs FIRST GHANA SAVINGS AND LOANS LTD'}}","1 page 90 para. 2-002 defines an offer “as an expression of willingness to contract made with the intention (actual or apparent) that it is to become binding on the person making it as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed’ According to the authors, “Under the objective test of agreement, an apparent intention to be bound may suffice, i.e. the alleged offeror may be bound if his words or conduct are such as to induce a reasonable person to believe that he intends to be bound, even though in fact he has no such intention” In her book The Law of Contract in Ghana (2011), published by Frontiers Printing and Publishing Company, Ghana the learned author, Dowuona-Hammond, states at para. 2 page 18 that “an offer may be defined as a statement or conduct indicating a willingness to contract on terms stated or on terms which can reasonably be inferred from conduct, and made with the intention that it will become binding as soon as it is accepted” In NTHC Ltd vs. Antwi \[2009\] SCGLR 117 at 125 the Supreme Court stated that: “an offer is an indication in words or by conduct by an offeror that he or she is prepared to be bound by a contract in the terms expressed in the offer, if the offeree communicates to the offeror his or her acceptance of those terms” The court is of the opinion that once it is shown that the 1st plaintiff either accepted, in writing, the terms in exhibit E or acted upon the directives in exhibit E, a contract can legitimately be inferred.",1.5571254,"{'booksReferredTo': [], 'caseId': {'number': 'RPC/03/2012', 'type': 'SUIT'}, 'casesReferredTo': [], 'combinedCounsel': ['MS.
